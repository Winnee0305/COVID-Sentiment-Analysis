gi3n6xs,How fast does the antigen go away. If you say the body recognizes the antigen as foreign again wouldn’t the antibodies made attack the antigen on your cells from the visuals I saw of how the vaccine is made your cells will wear the spike proteins . From the example it looks like your cells are covered in spikes like the actual covid virus is .

gquv4xv,There is mixed data on this. The P3 studies and U.K. data made it seem like you are close to 80% by day 14 but Israel data put it closer to ~50% with very little coverage at all before 14 days. Be careful out there you are almost to the end zone. You don’t want COVID now.

gqs71is,yes. this is a contentious topic of conversation. and often emotions run high. I just don't think things are black and white with this one. everyone is entitled to their opinion and everyone should have the human rights to decide what they want to do with their bodies. if the vaccine had been tested properly I would not have the ? marks hanging over it that I do. but it seems the rushed vaccine is being currently tested on the human population. and as you say yourself the experts are still trying to figure out this crap.I rather wait until they HAVE figured it out tbh. and I chose not to take the vaccine unless it's a last resort. and tbh I live in a very rural part of the country. no issues over here with anyones health. so not much point taking a relatively under-tested vaccine right now. stay safe,SN21BTC,2021-03-13 08:38:55+00:00,,0.248265306122449,0.0582436611008039,Positive,gqs3hmp,m3jwwe
gsqfpru,"I don't know for sure what you should expect re symptom duration but I would guess they will gradually improve (are they getting better so far?)  For someone with no prior covid the mRNA makes spike protein for a very short amount of time with a short (approx 24hr) half-life so the symptoms stop pretty abruptly.  Theoretically in case of prior especially recent covid you have cells with leftover non-replicating bits of viral protein and you just asked your immune system to go after them.  So it may stop more gradually but will get better as cells turn over etc. Since your workplace askedencouraged you to get vaccinated if you want to consider not getting the second dose (I wouldn't) show them these articles about recent investigations that make it pretty clear that the second dose does not improve immunity for those with prior covid.  Also if you are interested look up one of the authors Florian Krammer on twitter -- he is a great guy top virologistimmunologist at Mt. Sinai puts out lots of great info on his twitter and has been proponent of clarifying this issue.

gson2z6,I got strange side effects from the Pfizer vaccine as well roughly 7 days after the second dose. It scared the shit out of me and at that time I wished I hadn’t gotten the vaccine. But I did find others who had similar side effects and ALL of my side effects went away within two weeks. From what I’ve heard so did everyone else’s (that I spoke to). As scary as the side effects are they do go away. I would 100% go through the side effects I went through again to have the peace of mind to know that I likely won’t have severe complications if I contract Covid. I can now see my family and other vaccinated friends and it was worth it for me. Of course this is you’re decision and you’re decision alone. It’s your health and wellbeing. But it does seem that people are getting strange side effects and those side effects do go away. I hope you make the right decision for you and I hope if you do get the second dose that you don’t have strange side effects!,Woolama,2021-03-29 13:16:52+00:00,,0.3892857142857143,-0.0385989010989011,Negative,mfhkqv,mfhkqv

goe1k8c,That's an evolving issue.  Some weeks ago it was thought that COVID vaccines would be widely available in April.  That was based on the anticipated FDA approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson's one dose vaccine.  However the company announced that it would have just a few million doses immediately available when it is approved by the FDA.  So officials pushed the anticipated date back a month to May.  But keep in mind most experts have been anticipating for the last year that vaccine rationing would end somewhere around late spring - so we are on track.

ggwrpjq,You should ask before you take the vaccine. A medical professional administering the vaccine will have a better answer than you can get here.  Based on what I know about how the currently available vaccines work I'm going to guess not much.  To really dumb it down the vaccines trick your body into manufacturing a portion of the virus so that your body will act as if you are infected and make antibodies towards that portion of the virus.  Since your body thinks you are sick you may have a temporary set of symptoms related to your body fighting the imagined illness and feel sick.  But since it's a trick and the fake virus doesn't have the ability to keep replicating and overwhelm you and is absorbed by your body quickly those symptoms are temporary.  The antibodies you make in response last longer.  If you happen to also have real virus in your system the presence of additional fake virus isn't really going to change anything.  It's too late to help you get antibodies in place before you encounter the real thing but it shouldn't make anything appreciably worse.I want to emphasize again though that I'm not a doctor and not an immunologist and am answering based on a very basic biology degree and a little bit of understanding about this particular vaccine.  Ask your doctor.,Reneeisme,2020-12-24 16:35:51+00:00,,0.4650321239606954,-0.0230536659108087,Negative,kjfvyb,kjfvyb

gqtbcs1,Hello.You are polite and seem to possess empathy but I have to burst your bubble and tell you that there is another level of reality that you are not aware of. You are discussing the virus as if everything we are told is legitimate and suddenly governments vaccine companies pharmakeia the media and psychopaths like Bill Gates and Fauci are helpful entities who do right by other human beings. To think that means that you accept reality as it is presented to you and haven't investigated beyond what these corrupt agencies and people are telling us is fact. 28.8 million people have absolutely not got Covid in the US. That's an absolute crazy thing to believe in light of the PCR test being flawed. This article in the Lancet explains it well:Testing to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 asks not whether someone has RNA in their nose from earlier infection but whether they are infectious today. It is a net loss to the health social and economic wellbeing of communities if post-infectious individuals test positive and isolate for 10 days. In our view current PCR testing is therefore not the appropriate gold standard for evaluating a SARS-CoV-2 public health test.Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 are contagious for 4–8 days.7Specimens are generally not found to contain culture-positive (potentially contagious) virus beyond day 9 after the onset of symptoms with most transmission occurring before day 5.7  8This timing fits with the observed patterns of virus transmission (usually 2 days before to 5 days after symptom onset) which led public health agencies to recommend a 10-day isolation period.9The short window of transmissibility contrasts with a median 22–33 days of PCR positivity (longer with severe infections and somewhat shorter among asymptomatic individuals).10This suggests that 50–75% of the time an individual is PCR positive they are likely to be post-infectious.11  12Not that I needed that to prove it. Kary Mullis the creator of the PCR said as much about his invention in an online interview as well as stating that Fauci was basically a villain with an ulterior motive who knows nothing about his field of so called expertise. The front men for this scam Gates Fauci Handcock are evil lying entities who the discerning know should be in prison or worse for their crimes against humanity. The vaccine as they are stating in the mainstream only now as they know many people have taken it does not stop you getting Covid nor transmitting it. The narrative in fact is stating that Covid vaccine recipients can be superspreaders. You can believe the abundance of inconsistencies contradictions and ridiculous lies that only programmed children could believe but millions who have looked beyond the 'lies damn lies and statistics' have been awoken to this depopulation agenda which is preparing the world for the 'Great Reset' Orwellian bio-security state that the psychopaths in power want to bring in. The vaccine is a bio-weapon nothing less.Before you make a decision listen to some independent experts who are speaking out about this evil:,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-13 17:05:32+00:00,,0.5140639847956922,-0.0313351282863477,Negative,gqsmlvx,m38xhp

I did feel very hot today (had to take off my big jacket while going for a walk in 20 degree weather very unlike me) and have had really bad joint pain in my left ankle (also had it with my first dose).

gn2q6ly,"to quote ualphas12&gt;The second dose is much more brutal with 5 to 10% for sever reactions and 45% requiring pain medication.OH NO... I had to take 3 regular strength Tylenol pills (so essentially half a dose x 3) after my second injection.Truthfully there ARE legitimate reasons to be concerned.  BUT there are also major concerns for getting COVID and what happens.I do believe there have been a VERY SMALL number of people who have had serious reactions to the vaccine (and some elderly people that have died).  But that danger also exists with ANY vaccination or medication.  Go to your medicine cabinet and read the warning labels on every drug that's in there.  You may not ever want to take them again.Regarding your mother's friend the honest answer right now is ""nobody really knows"".  I can tell you that it's not ""normal"".  The only ""shaking"" that I personally know of from people who have had the vaccine is type of ""shaking"" or ""shivering"" that sometimes happens when you have a fever.  But that goes away when the fever subsides.  For the people that are having some sort of longer-term side effects there's a reasonable suspicion that there is something about their bodies that has made them more susceptible to these conditions.  It's the same type of thing for people that have genetic predispositions towards some types of cancer.For ""normal"" side effects what I've heard (and personally experienced) is that the majority of people end up with a sore arm after the first injection.  The second injection is the one that ends up causing ""major"" side effects.  But ""major"" ends up being ""feeling like you have the flu for a day"".  I personally was sick on the couch with a fever for 24 hours due to the 2nd shot.  So yeah it was a ""severe"" reaction based on the definition of ""unable to do daily activities"".  I was sick on the couch feeling like crap... big deal.In my home state (Louisiana) there have been 417000 COVID cases to date (and 9000 deaths).  We've just surpassed the point where more people have had the first vaccination dose (482000) than were diagnosed with COVID.  217000 people have completed both vaccination doses.  If there were major bad reactions to the vaccinations (bad meaning more than just ""sick for a day"") it would be very well known. The vaccinations have all happened over the course of 3 months versus an entire year of COVID cases.And yes it's true that we don't know the long-term effects of the COVID vaccination but we're already seeing indications of what the long term effects of having had COVID could be.  Even for people who don't seem to get very sick it does damage their lungs and other organs.  These people could be fine now but in 10 years we start to see the fallout from this damage.",ChrisC1234,2021-02-12 16:54:56+00:00,,0.4848382822850909,-0.0402988855116514,Negative,li99jr,li99jr

ghd1inx,I just think the shot is useless but I’ll have to get it because of work eventually the world has changed so much I believe a global pandemic will serve as a reminder that we need a functioning healthcare system. When you’re relatively healthy it’s easy to forget why we pour so much money into healthcare; consequently there’s always pressure to cut funding to the notoriously expensive sector. The pandemic has been a real stress test to show how much extra weight the systems can carry. I hope healthcare funding will become prioritised a little higher going forward.TelehealthJust as the world has discovered you actually can work from home they’ve discovered medical appointment can be conducted by phone. I hope people will keep in mind that a phone consultation is a poor substitute for a face to face but the cat’s out of the bag saying it can’t be done. Telehealth is now a thing. As much as I like the idea of working on my laptop in some tropical paradise I hope we don’t forget the value of clinical examination.Infection controlOne year ago you couldn’t find a lay person who knew what R Nought means now you can’t find a person in their senses who hasn’t heard of herd immunity. Just about everyone can hold a conversation on droplets and fomites we’ve shirked the handshake and acquired masks and we’ve suddenly become cognisant of human contact being a prerequisite for viral illness. None of this is specific to COVID-19 the same rules of epidemiology apply to seasonal influenza and equally importantly the common cold.AntibioticsPeople have also been shown what a virus looks like and explained why it won’t go away with a course of antibiotics. It’s still very much a daily grind for doctors to argue with patients whether they should or shouldn’t be prescribed antibiotics. I can only hope people will finally take this lesson to heart and stop insisting on futile antibiotics; we still have an antibiotic resistance problem we need to figure out.,lcc101,2020-12-29 04:23:12+00:00,,0.3868055555555554,0.0206597222222222,Positive,ghaol3a,klk218

Even I’d it didn’t kill me the thought of being on a ventilator for even a few hours terrifies me and I’m concerned about long term organ damage. Getting the vaccine will enable me to circulate more freely in public. I can catch the virus but I won’t be sickened by it. I would be asymptomatic which sounds good to me. Of course I will continue to wear a mask to help curb any spread on my part. Btw I had the antibodies test a few months ago and learned that false negatives are extremely common.

gql1z3s,I think there’s always that chance of your immune system going haywire! It’s just dependent on the person. Good example is those individuals who have an autoimmune disease that is hyperactive such as vasculitis. Their immune system is already beefy enough to take care of a viral infection and if they receive a vaccine their immune system might mount too strong of a response that would result into a true issue and become fatal (due to their overactive immune system) generally those people don’t get vaccines like the flu or covid because these may trigger that hyperactive response and risks outweigh the benefits.Now if you come into contact with another virus after your immune system worked hard against a vaccine or another pathogen that would be an opportunistic infection and it might do the opposite in that your immune system is too weak to fight it off and cause issues where you can’t neutralize the pathogen enough to feel better. That’s why they make you wait two weeks between vaccines (unless you go to boot camp and get them all in one day which is not good at all thanks U.S. military lmao) that way your immune system has time to react to whatever pathogen is being presented by the vaccine and it can correctly respond to it. But if it mounts too strong of a response or too little after seeing two different pathogens it might lead to sepsis and you become hospitalized. But that’s rare and usually happens with immunocompromised people!,THelperCell,2021-03-11 15:59:24+00:00,,0.5367424242424241,0.0920454545454545,Positive,gqkt7x7,m2hfh5

I have the same question as you even though I have read up on these things for a long time and followed it.  I also have questions like how effective are these long term?  And a lot more.&amp; x200B;My biggest concern and questions surround the antibodies both from the virus and from the vaccine itself based off data I have seen reported.  Was not surprised when they started talking about how the vaccines were not effective against the mutations or any of that.  J&amp;J supposedly has advantage of being effective against these new strains though only slightly.  But that does not answer the question of if people get the virus after vaccinated and they can do they still have potential to get damage?  &amp; x200B;I think your question is a great one.

l29b46,Allergy or Anxiety? I got my first dose of Moderna on 11121 as part of a large drive thru mega clinic (I qualify due to a medical condition). I had a lot of anxiety surrounding the vaccine to the point where I only slept maybe an hour the night before and then had to wait in a very long car line for my turn to get the dose (which I almost left a few times because I freaked myself out). I also hadn't eaten well all day because I was so nervous.&amp; x200B;When I got the shot I was fine for several minutes and pulled off into the observation area. I started getting a little lightheadeddizzy a few minutes later and for a few seconds I thought I was having trouble breathing but realized that my anxiety was causing the shortness of breath. After another few minutes I had a rapid pounding heartbeat that lasted maybe a minute or two and then that passed. I guess my main concern is the rapid heartbeat since I've seen that listed as an allergic response. I had no itching no redness at the injection site until two days later and by the time I got home from the clinic which took about 35 minutes I felt mostly fine if not just a little shaky and tired from such a long day.&amp; x200B;Side effects after the shot: the next morning my arm was incredibly painful it felt like I had been stabbed a couple of times in the same spot. I had some dizziness and a fever that peaked at 101.7 but a warm bath brought it down and I didn't have to take any medicine. The next day my skin was red and warm about two inches below the injection site but that was gone by the next morning. I had a little bit of upset stomach the second day but nothing terrible.

I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time and got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine a week ago because a site had extra doses that needed to be used. I got a card with a reminder to get my second dose in a month. Problem is I don’t know where or how to get my second dose. I got my shot at a pop up site with my local health department at a church and I’ve looked everywhere to find information about getting a second shot and I can’t find anything for my situation. I figured I’d ask here in case anyone has been in a similar situation. I’m not technically eligible so am I able to set up an appointment because I’ve had my first dose? I kind of doubt it and I don’t want to take appointments from someone who is more eligible than me but I’m just confused.,Calliexxe,2021-03-04 07:05:25+00:00,30.0,0.3739880952380952,0.1427380952380952,Positive,1,lxewwj

It means her immune system is fighting the presence of what looks like the covid virus and making the parts of the immune system needed to fight actual covid if she were to get exposed in the future.

gjwi6yt,i came here to find any info on anybody else who has anxiety and has received the vaccine so i'm pretty happy to have found this thread. i've had anxiety for as long as i can remember although as i've gotten older i've been very good with managing it and have not had any panic attacks for years. after getting my first dose of the moderna vaccine within five minutes i feel i had some kind of response to the injection that was very similar to a panic attack. since i haven't had one in so long i almost forgot what they felt like but i am so confused as to why within just a few minutes of getting poked i started having a racing heart beat the sensation of difficulty breathing and dissociation. i didn't raise any alarm to those around me as i didn't want to scare anybody but i was struggling internally to keep my composure. i'm confused as i wasn't too nervous about getting vaccinated and i am not afraid of needles as i am diabetic. i was simply reading through the paperwork they gave me after the vaccine and these feelings came over me without warning. a few days after vaccination my arm was a normal amount of sore and i just felt strange. something felt off but i can only describe it as feeling strange for about three days. i've been worried about the second dose because i don't want to go through the sensations i felt immediately after being injected again and definitely don't want to feel them again if it's going to be more intense. if you've read this far thank you and please let me know if anybody has personally had this type of reaction or has heard of anybody having something similar.,maesterroshi,2021-01-20 02:35:22+00:00,,0.5249559082892418,0.1046913580246913,Positive,kxm587,kxm587

keq6mr,"Pfizer Vaccine Experience I work in a hospital and I got the Pfizer vaccine today as part of the ""Phase 1a"" rollout of the vaccine in Texas. I wanted to share my experience to answer some of the questions that might be out there about the vaccine.First a bit of background - I work at a fairly large but rural hospital in Texas. We received our first supply of the Pfizer vaccine (currently inconveniently named ""BNT162b2"") on Monday and began vaccinating our healthcare employees on Tuesday December 15. The vaccine is considered voluntary and employees are not forced to get the vaccine to continue working. Previously employees filled out a survey where we could opt in for the vaccine. Even after opting in employees had the option to change their mind up until they received their shot. Suffice to say I decided to go all the way. I've been cautiously optimistic about the vaccine for a while and aside from seasonal allergies I have a fairly unremarkable medical history. Also when the nursing department said that there would be free lollipops... well that sealed the deal for me.Our hospital set up pre-planned COVID vaccination times to keep things organized and I showed up to my 3:15PM slot a few minutes early since I half-expected to see a cluster-F. I was a little disappointed to see that things were actually pretty mellow. There was a check-in process that involved filling out a one-page consent form with a 6-page easy-to-read primer on the vaccine COVID-19 and potential side effects; TLDR = You're getting two 30 mcg shots 21-days apart. They also introduced a CDC app V-Safe that would send us a weekly survey to ask for side-effects. They encouraged us to report any side effect of any intensity on the survey whether it was severe or just minor arm pain. V-Safe is completely optional and voluntary and they said we could get the vaccine without worrying about V-Safe.The check-in process took about 5 minutes total; faster than I expected. They asked me which arm should receive the vaccine and I picked left since I've never liked that arm. When they pulled out the vaccine syringe I realized that I was suddenly a tad nervous. When I get nervous I talk a lot. I talked about how small the needle looked; I compared it to a flu shot needle. I talked about how the vaccine syringe had a translucent semi-clear off-white look to it. The syringe itself looked really narrow and innocuous. After talking about the syringe I talked about how I talk a lot when I get nervous. While talking I spotted the bowl of lollipops and talked about those too. At some point in my monologue the nurse saw her window nodded at me for permission and I frowned and nodded back. The actual injection was extremely unremarkable. I expected a stinging sharpness but instead it felt more like a dull numbing sort of discomfort. I was worried that the actual liquid would be extra viscous or acidic and as the nurse was injecting me I was fearful that it would be like that one year where the flu shot with the H1N1 strain really sucked and caused a sore arm right after. But instead I felt more surprised by how much the injection itself didn't hurt. I wasn't even sure that I had gotten the vaccine until later when I saw a small dot of dried blood on my bandaid.After the shot they hand you a small vaccination card that shows the date and location of your 1st shot and it reminds you that you still have to get a 2nd shot after 21 days. I noticed that the day of the vaccination is being counted as Day 0 and so tomorrow is Day 1. After the shot they had me sit in a waiting room for 15 minutes to watch for an allergic reaction. They even handed me a placard that read ""You must wait until 3:35PM"" before I could leave observation. I took this time to sign up for V-Safe (which took about 2 minutes) text some friends and then stare out the window before I was free to go back to work.As I'm typing this post it's been about 6.5 hours since I've gotten the vaccine and I haven't noticed any unusual pain or side-effects yet. From the NEJM article about the vaccine ( I'm preparing myself for some combination of a headache andor fatigue and I wouldn't be surprised if my arm hurts more in the morning As of right now though I haven't noticed anything out of place in my body unless I stop to focus on my arm and ask ""Does my arm hurt at all?"" and I guess the answer to that is ""Yeah I guess it qualifies as a 1 out of 10 on the discomfort scale."" It hasn't limited any of my activities at this point and I've been able to jog do some pull-ups and light exercise without any problems. It's been extremely mundane so far and my only real angst right now is that I forgot to pick up a lollipop on my way out of observation. But I'm also trying to stay cautious and remind myself that stuff can still happen either in the next few days or with the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. Still I'm a bit relieved with how things have gone so far.I hope my experience has provided a data point for you guys about the literal vaccination process. If you guys have any questions about my experience feel free to ask and I'll see if I can provide something useful.",Garfield3d,2020-12-17 04:21:53+00:00,25.0,0.4634238591269841,0.0494140625,Positive,1,keq6mr

mgk9jg,How long did your side effects last? (Moderna) First shot on Sunday the 21st. Almost exactly 24 hours later had that feeling of a cold coming on- fatigue post nasal drip muscle aches etc. This happened every afternoon from Monday to Thursday. Overall it didn’t worry me was happy that my immune system was having a response. Saturday (6 days later) my arm started hurting for the first time. Monday weakness in my left arm and my left shoulder blade went completely numb which was  disconcerting. Today Tuesday there is still weakness and a subtle annoying pain in the upper area of my left arm occasionally pins and needles. For reference I’m a woman in my early forties. I get my flu shot annually with no issues other than arm pain updated Tdap and MMR in the last few years with arm pain only.Curious about the average length of symptoms. Anyone else having symptoms longer than the literature indicates (“a few days”).? This delayed arm pain or numbness thing happen to anyone?

The CDC recommends “People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the criteria for discontinuing isolation; those without symptoms should also wait until they meet the criteria before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine”.

No other side effects. I went to bed early and slept hard through the night. Woke up no issues. That whole next day the arm was a little more sore than previous day. I took one 500mg Tylenol and that was it. Soreness was comparable to a really hard workout. Day 3 which is about the 55hr mark since the shot. Arm isn’t sore anymore at all.

mhitut,Bad experience with AstraZeneca So I got my first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Tuesday the 30th of March about 11 am. For context I am a 21 yr male who is healthy. At first I felt perfectly fine with no pain in my arm or any side effects. This lasted until about 5 pm and it hit me hard. I started feel a bit drowsy and dizzy at first until I found myself completely bed ridden. My whole body started to ache and my skin was very sensitive to touch. I had a high fever of 38 degrees Celsius (100 Fahrenheit). I felt very nauseous and lost any appetite. My eyes were very sensitive to light. I could not believe how fast I went downhill.  Overnight I got very little sleep waking up sweating then waking up freezing. I eventually got to sleep and woke up at 2 pm the next day. I felt slightly better now being able to move around. I found that paracetamol would help with the headache and pain a bit. The nausea was mostly gone but would come and go throughout the day. The dizziness and sensitive skin were the main things that remained. This brings me to today being the 1st of April. The side effects are mostly gone with a slight headache sensitive skin and I also suddenly have a sore throat. With the side effects now going away hopefully I feel fresh tomorrow. My adviceBe prepared. I got the vaccine not knowing anything about the side effects thinking that because I am young I would fine. Food and water. Make sure you have enough food in the house. It’s important to keep your energy levels high to help your body process the vaccine. Guzzle down water even when you are not thirsty.,Bermoo,2021-03-31 23:46:07+00:00,6.0,0.5268888888888889,0.167781746031746,Positive,1,mhitut
gr4qx8q,A. Right now two types of vaccines are available: those that use messenger RNA (mRNA) and ones that use a modified adenovirus to present the viral spike protein to the immune system. The goal of vaccination is to familiarize the immune system with the spike protein of the virus so that when someone is exposed the person’s immune response can evolve much more quickly and gain control of the virus before severe illness develops. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use synthetic mRNA to instruct muscle cells to make the viral spike protein.Vaccines that use mRNA are remarkably safe; mRNA has been termed the “instruction set for life.” It is used regularly to instruct every cell in our body on which proteins to make. They are produced in the nucleus of the cell by being copied from your DNA. They then go out into the main part of the cell where proteins are made and tell the cell’s protein production machinery what proteins to make. Once the instructions are read the mRNA decays and its pieces are recycled to the nucleus to make new mRNA. The mRNA vaccines work the same way. The mRNA in these vaccines tell your muscle cells to make the viral spike protein. Once these instructions are delivered the mRNA is degraded over 12 hours and the spike protein that is created as a preview for the immune system disappears over 48 hours.The Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) vaccine that was reviewed by the FDA on Feb. 27 uses a modified adenovirus that can enter cells but can’t replicate inside them or cause illness. The adenovirus carries instructions to the cell nucleus to make mRNA encoding the viral spike protein. As in the case of mRNA vaccines in which the mRNA is directly delivered the adenovirus vaccine-associated mRNA migrates out of the nucleus and tells the cell to make the viral spike protein. The adenovirus used in these vaccines is defective and cannot grow further. It is quickly degraded and disappears,bluemoldy,2021-03-16 15:27:55+00:00,,0.3711935500397039,0.2119547119547119,Positive,gr3v9pv,m61dmh

gsyndfm,Your best bet is lay off the alcohol for a bit post-vaccine. Alcohol provides the body with absolutely no nutrients dehydrates the body and is filtered through the liver. One study from 2004 when testing the SARS vaccine rmva-S indicated elevated levels of an enzyme that indicates liver damage in ferrets. It seems there could be something to study with the COVID-19 vaccines mRNA or DNA but most likely has not yet been studied because in science time we've hardly moved the needle. There's no harm in giving your body a few days to 'recoup' from the vaccine without alcohol since there is a possibility of your liver working harder for a period of time after receiving the vaccine. If you think you'll have withdraw symptoms from going a few days to a week without alcohol I advise you speak with a professional about getting some help.,dolcememory,2021-03-31 21:46:02+00:00,,0.3935185185185185,0.0787037037037036,Positive,mhc2lm,mhc2lm

He was concerned that the MRNA vaccine could produce prions. I was doubtful but I Google searched something about how the spike protein has prion like qualities and that's why it is so infectious. For anyone with more intimate knowledge of mRNA reproducing parts of spike protein can you explain to me how possible or impossible the chances of having secondary changes to our proteins with using mRNA vaccines.

However it takes a few weeks to build immunity after receiving the vaccine. That being said if you were exposed to covid shortly before or after receiving the vaccine then it’s possible that you may get sick due to the fact that your body has not had enough time to build antibodies.,capuccinohedgie,2021-02-01 02:42:01+00:00,,0.4915178571428572,-0.1128652597402597,Negative,l94utl,l94utl

Seriously because if you can’t your spouting utter bull crap. You’re making grand claims with no backing -exactly what you think the government is doing; oh the irony! Surely saying “means nothing once a virus circumnavigates the vaccines effect” means that you agree that the vaccine does work? At least at first? No one is telling you how it will mutate no one is claiming to know how it will mutate -again you’re just making up stuff to suit your own bias. All they’re saying is this will help you not die from something that’s it; for me and for many others that alongside the strict testing the vaccines went through is enough. For others like you it isn’t. That’s ok. What’s not okay is coming to a forum for people who are having the vaccine and telling them how bad their decisions is.

It was intense but very quick and then all was well. This morning I looked at my arm in the mirror and I now have a baseball sized red circle around the injection site.

lbw24r,Moderna 2nd vaccine (27 F) I received the 2nd moderna vaccine about 72 hrs ago. Here’s how it went:1st 24 hours: I received the vaccine at about 4:30 pm took 400 mg ibuprofen beforehand. I took 500 mg Tylenol around 8 pm and fell asleep shortly after with no noticed side effects. I woke up around 3 am with chills and body aches that felt like a burning sensation in my lower back and joints. I took more Ibuprofen and fell asleep after an hour of laying awake due to pain. Woke up the next morning with fatigue and took more Tylenol. I went to work and felt tired but able to perform my job duties (nurse). I did notice more musclejoint pain at work if I went too long without TylenolIbuprofen. 24 hrs after vaccine: At the 24 hr mark I felt intense body aches fever (100.4) and chills. It was difficult to walk to the restroom due to pain. I went to bed and woke up a few hours later due to body ache pains (intense burning sensation in my joints and lower back) and fever. I took ibuprofen and fell asleep shortly after.36-48 hrs after vaccine: Called in sick to work — unable to get out of bed due to headache body aches and fever. Slept in until 11 am and felt 100% fine once I woke up. I was able to eat lunch and still feel back to normal with no pain. Overall I am healthy and not used to “feeling sick”.

ghv1r6r,"Okay I guess I can tell you I know dozens of patients who have passed away with COVID and many more friends who didn't die and spent months after COVID feeling like crap.But think about it the following way: The vaccine is mRNA for the same Spike protein the virus makes surrounded by a lipid membrane. The lipid membrane is similar to the membrane that surrounds your cells which is why it's put there in the first place (makes sure the mRNA is not broken down before it gets inside the cell). The other component mRNA can only do one thing namely make Spike protein. It is physically impossible for that mRNA to ""alter"" your genes or do anything else. mRNA is the same blueprint of which your cells make millions or billions of copies every day to build necessary proteins.So given neither the fatty acids in the lipid nanoparticle nor the mRNA itself can conceivably produce anything except copies of the viral spike protein the only potential risk is spike protein. If you're exposed to the virus you WILL be exposed to spike protein vaccine or no vaccine. If the protein causes any adverse effects it will do so whether you are vaccinated or you get the real deal.**BUT** when you get the real COVID you're **ALSO** exposed to envelope proteins viral RNA and every other component of a fully functioning virus that can actually harm you in the short run and the long run.There is simply no way that real COVID is less risky than the vaccine.",pneumophila,2021-01-02 20:57:56+00:00,,0.4425834701696772,0.053831417624521,Positive,ght7nxr,ko7n69

People who don't get the vaccine may experience travel bans being banned from public locations (shops restaurants etc).  Its not just as simple as ""Don't get the vaccine if you don't want"".  This is my issue how can they force you to take a vaccine without even telling us what's in it.  There's been NO long term testing properly tested and tried vaccines physically can't be made that quickly!  This could potentially kill everyone who takes it.  It's absolutely insane.  Again it doesn't stop you spreading or getting Covid it stops you dying from it so you'll still get your lung damage etc whether you take it or not.",supersaiyankakarot94,2021-01-20 13:25:34+00:00,,0.4518518518518518,-0.0468855218855218,Negative,l15x8y,l15x8y
gsr8y78,My mom and aunt got the vaccine. After the vaccine my aunt was diagnosed with a thyroid problem and my mom with a heart problem because they started having symptoms. Aftee going to the doctor both of those problems are the types that take a long time to develop... not a week or two. Every day new people get diagnosed with disease. But it happens to be that EVERYONE is getting the vaccine now. So of course the chances of people getting a new diagnosis post vaccine is common. Many coincidences are happening. For that reason i had monitored my heart prior to my vaccine because i heard of people reporting cardiac side effects. Discovered that i have an arrhythmia the day before my vaccine. After my vaccine i felt my heart palpitating. Had i not checked my heart out prior to my vaccine i would have attributed my heart rhythm problem to the vaccine.,make_tea_notwar,2021-03-30 01:57:34+00:00,,0.2886363636363636,0.046590909090909,Positive,mfbq91,mfbq91

gnldi7c,Had Oxford sat 11am felt really good. Took it easy..drove back and has a lazy weekend. This afternoon for about 6 hours I felt like I was in a freezer and everything ached. X2 paracetamol and felt 50% better. Would do it again tomorrow.. would much rather have 5 chest infections (at separate times!!) than one round with Covid-19.I have heard of some people possibly having had Covid come and go before having the jab and then being quite sick and fluy for a week. But again..I am sure that is a better deal than the possible alternative!! So my advice would be if you honestly feel you have had covid or know you have then clear the diary and keep warm and stock up for a box set week!The staff are doing an amazing job. Felt very safe and clean and well managed. And I even got a sticker!!All leaflets and press mention booking your 2nd jab this was obviously printed way before news of success rates with one singular dose now from Johnson and Johnson.. will be interesting to see if they vaccinate the entire country to keep everyone safe and then offer 2nd jab as a booster or if they will stick to the original plan of offering 2nd jabs before all ages and priority groups are completed.Good luck with your vaccine if you are booked..don't arrive too early I got sent away and I was only 6 min's ahead of schedule.,snoopy-peanut,2021-02-16 00:39:13+00:00,,0.5447987528344671,0.2157100340136054,Positive,ky5ug0,ky5ug0

gww895y,Nearly everyone I know that had the vaccine had little to no side effects. I think the anxiety about it was the hardest for me. My wife has weird reactions to a lot of medication and I was worried for her. We both had the Pfizer vaccination. Second day I felt mildly sick headache brain fog. Both of us had sore arms.  The second shot I had nothing but a sore arm my wife threw up the morning after mild fever body aches. Swollen lymph node in her armpit. Tylenol helped. In either case by day three we were mostly better. Nearly every new vaccine that comes out has rumors and misinformation associated with it. The last new one HPV had basically the same myths for the longest time with none of them based on reality. The way I see it you have some people that believe there is a way to get past this PPE Hygiene Vaccination etc. There is another group that seems to refuse to do anything with the hopes that it will go away on its own.,Preachwhendrunk,2021-05-04 11:36:23+00:00,,0.4338600288600288,0.0169516594516594,Positive,n44v3g,n44v3g

Today I had a student about two feet away from me for 30 minutes (we physically couldn’t distance more due to the room and number of students there). Both of us masked. Student says “I have a headache so bad and feel like I have a sinus intention.” Student sneezes into mask and coughs. Mom said she had to go to school unless she had a fever or throwing up. Student emails this afternoon to say her sibling tested positive for Covid- which I’m assuming means she has it also. In my state I’m not required to quarantine since we both had a mask on.

gwk9nvy,I am 2 weeks post first dose Pfizer and finally starting to feel better. I had an excess build up of mucus to the point I actually would wake up choking on my saliva. I also had a lot of other really bizarre symptoms that landed me being admitted into hospital. All my tests for everything including covid were negative. A lot of the symptoms I and other people are getting are very similar to Covid symptoms I believe it’s an immune response and differs a little for everyone .

m1ykk7,Why do people try to make others who don’t want the Covid jab feel bad? Hang on... let me get this right. So the vaccine is supposed to make symptoms of Covid less severe. So people who’ve had the vaccine might potentially not even realise they have covid then because of the decreased symptoms? Then unknowingly spreading to others. Isn’t this completely going against the whole point of staying “safe”. How is that keeping people safe if people don’t know they’ve got it? It’s doing quite the opposite in my opinion 🤔 It is a fact that it is unknown whether the vaccine will completely protect against contracting covid or spreading it. Hence why we still must wear masks and distance ourselves from others even after receiving the vaccine. So why is this vaccine being pushed onto people so much when we know so little about the effects?,Dopatri,2021-03-10 14:23:24+00:00,25.0,0.4620748299319728,0.0236819727891156,Positive,1,m1ykk7

I figured all the symptoms I was experiencing were part of the vaccine effects but it went on for several days when I finally went in to get tested.

You may not know anyone like me who has had to isolate themselves their wife and their kid since March because they have a genetic immune disorder that makes getting COVID a guaranteed death sentence. Maybe it hasn’t cost you a friend or a loved one. Maybe it hasn’t cost you your job or maybe you don’t know anyone who can’t sleep at night because they’re overwhelmed by all that back rent they’ll have to pay if they ever get another job. Perhaps you’ve grown accustomed to this new normal and you’re okay with it because your life easily adapted to it. In those cases it makes sense to be more worried about the medicine then the virus itself if you personally have not suffered from its consequences.Hopefully COVID doesn’t touch your life but for a lot of people for a lot of different reasons the vaccine is necessary to get things back to normal.

merb97,Covid vaccine and sleep deprivation I’ve been given the opportunity to get a vaccine this upcoming Tuesday which was a huge excitement and relief for me but I’ve been having an issue that is making me think I should cancel my appointment. Lately I’ve been dealing with sleep maintenance insomnia that was brought about by anxiety a few weeks ago. Because of this my sleep hours really vary night to night but at worst it can be very little. Naturally I was concerned about the interaction so I googled and it seems a vaccine is overall less effective if you haven’t had good sleep recently. It seems sleep afterwards doesn’t even make a difference. Because of this I’m thinking I should cancel my appointment if I can’t get good sleep in the next couple days and wait until I’m doing better. But of course after the long wait it’s not the easiest pill to swallow. Does anyone with knowledge about this kind of thing have any recommendations? Is it wise to wait until I’m sleeping better or is it better to get it sooner even if it’s less effective?,thecompletebreakfast,2021-03-28 01:12:34+00:00,3.0,0.4878787878787879,0.1805871212121212,Positive,1,merb97

gt0yisj,Nope Covid cases are rising BECAUSE of vaccinations as is starting to come out. 50% of the people that have died of the vaccination did so in the first 24 hours because of what they are doing to the immune system. I don't know what the mechanism is but there are care homes with residents who were all tested as Covid free before taking the shot and then all tested positive after. Many of the same people in the homes died after taking the venom.Regarding my ´uninformed paranoiac hyperbole´ you are very much still stuck in Plato´s cave on this issue. There are things going on in this world which haven't become apparent to you because you accept the world as it is presented to you. Tolstoy wrote this about you:“I know that most men—not only those considered clever but even those who are very clever and capable of understanding most difficult scientific mathematical or philosophic problems—can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed perhaps with much difficulty—conclusions of which they are proud which they have taught to others and on which they have built their lives.” And I'll add this quote from an unknown source:“Intelligent people do not allow an experimental biological agent to be injected into their body to combat a so-called virus that has a 99.7% survival rate without any treatment”Stop working for evil.,ManofManySorrows,2021-04-01 12:57:40+00:00,,0.5350785634118967,0.1655780022446689,Positive,gsz7fy8,memnfj

kupj2u,Ethical Dilemma Dilemma - I don't meet the requirements in my state to get the covid vaccine in the initial rollout. I have a friend who owns a nursing home who offered to give me the vaccine by listing me as a worker. Should I take it?Background - I am middle aged with a few chronic health issues but none so critical as would make me super high risk on paper were I to get covid. However I have a daughter who is immunocompromised  and I was advised by her doctors to get vaccinated as soon as I can to protect her. Her doctors are fighting for their young patients to get pushed up the list for vaccination rollout so hopefully she herself will be able to get it soon. What would you do? If I don't take up this offer I likely wont be getting it in my state until the summer or later. I don't want to take the vaccine away from a front line health worker but I also would do almost anything if it protects my daughter.,kokokeys,2021-01-10 23:09:01+00:00,23.0,0.4276388888888889,0.0827777777777777,Positive,1,kupj2u

gnulabu,Okay this is exactly what I got on this sub to look up or post about. I'm honestly kind of relieved that other people are having similar responses. The last provider I consulted with said I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine even though the previous one said it was likely an auto immune reaction. I got the vaccine last Tuesday and woke up at 4am on Saturday (so ~80hrs after my 2nd dose) with hives on one arm. On Sunday the hives went over to my other arm and both days took over the counter allergy meds and it mostly relieved the symptoms for the day. On the 3rd day I went until mid day without hives but then they showed up on my legs. I'm on day 4 of offon hives and talked to a nurse and then a NP who told me to just take loratadine during the day and 50 mg of benadryl at night. If it doesn't resolve in 3-4 days the last provider suggested I take prednisone.     As I type I'm itchy all around  (back stomach legs arms) and I'm starting to see the small red patches of hives showing up on my arms again. :( It's not the worst response but it's definitely annoying and very surprising since I thought I was in the clear and have never had a reaction to any meds like this. Anyhow I hope you feel better soon! Cheers to being vaccinated and getting over the side effects soon.,stillnotaplaya,2021-02-18 04:07:39+00:00,,0.384,0.0107333333333333,Positive,llp9uc,llp9uc

gsrtxk9,If your getting no where with doctors consider that you probably had the anti-bodies when you got the vaccine and despite what you’ve heard...there are studies now that prove immunity after the illness for at least 8 months. So the current ‘wait until 90 days’ is not ‘science’.Consider that you might be dealing with the main issue of Covid...inflammation. Make sure your blood sugars are within range BP and pulse. Ibuprofen can reduce inflammation really well so can a low starch diet. There are some good supplements as well but every one is different.

ghcryam,You can get vaccinated and still possibly spread it. Scientists have said there wasn’t enough time to determine if the vaccine actually stops people from transmitting it to others. So you can get vaccinated and still spread it to others. Everyone is going to have a difference of opinion on this. I’m not an anti-vaxxer. I’ve always stayed up to date on all my vaccines and get the flu shot every year. But I’m not taking the COVID vaccine YET - until there’s been research done to show and prove that there are no significant long term effects that would be detrimental to my health in the long run. People shouldn’t be shamed because they want to make sure they’re safe in the long run especially if they’re still going to continue the safety measures of keeping themselves and their loved ones safe.

gmtv4um,I know that an in-law was telling my wife that she had 5 days were she could not use her arm after the second shot.  Sucks because about 5 weeks later she got COVID and was down with a moderate case for a few days and then had some symptoms after for a while.&amp; x200B;But my wife got her first and her arm was fine.  She has had chillshot flashes since.  Sore throat as well.  They tested her and no strep or anything.  She had not been anywhere other than work where she has literally no contact with anyone.  And then home.  We do all our shopping online for delivery or pickup and no contact.&amp; x200B;It seems to follow with what others we know have had.  Brother-in-law works at the prison.  They had a huge outbreak with over 1k inmates sick.  He has his shots weeks ago with the arm issues and sore throat and all that.  They would not let him come in until it resolved.  This was his second dose.  He ended up with a mild case of COVID low grade fever with shortness of breath but nothing bad.  They sent his sample for testing for variant I guess.  They suspect the reason the guards were getting sick after they have had the shots is a variant.&amp; x200B;With all this it seems like these mild side effects are common because of the number of people we know with these things.  That arm thing did not hit my wife but has a lot of people here.  I would give it a couple more days and then if you are still having it and concerned contact your doctor.

Then I received dose  2 on Wednesday at 3:30pm. That night I had feverchills body aches headache. Honestly I thought it was just the vaccine - seemed pretty coincidental 9 hours post-vaccine. So Employee Health at my work suggested I get tested. I got tested Thursday around 3:30pm and tested positive :( I understand this is apparently not possible with PCR testing. Wondering if this happened to anyone else though. Employee health said I must have just been asymptomatic this entire time and the vaccine triggered symptoms.

In the next 10 minutes the rash had spread to the entire portion of my upper body and was burningitching like crazy. I was sent downstairs to the ED after being threatened with an epi pen that I refused (I was breathing fine no throat itching or closing up feelings). Rash went away after about an hour I did have some dizziness too with it. I was given a steroid shot. But now it’s been about 20 hours and I feel absolutely terrible! Headache fatigue nausea diarrhea body aches etc. Feels like the flu. There’s  soreness at the injection site and some redness still which I feel is expected . Has this happened to anyone else? I don’t think with the reaction I had that I’ll be able to get the next shot..not that I’m sure I want to at this point. Really wish I could have gotten the Pfizer.,AudgetheGreat,2020-12-30 17:55:08+00:00,19.0,0.4183760683760684,0.0012820512820512,Positive,1,kn71ew

The studies don’t show any difference in effectiveness of the medications and the difference in side effects are largely attributed to dosing recommendations still primarily based on male physiology.I doubt there’s any literature that directly answers your specific question but keep looking and at the very least get yourself on the schedule for the vaccine as soon as you can and ask the doctor about your concerns then you can make a more informed decision without further delaying your immunization.,NotQuiteStableGenius,2021-01-04 14:10:14+00:00,,0.4173571428571428,0.1324285714285714,Positive,kq8w1v,kq8w1v

gg7udjh,Pregnant patients and breastfeeding patients are absolutely eligible to get the vaccine. Currently neither of those are contraindications to getting the vaccine. In the United States at least the only real consensus is it's-kinda-up-to-the-mom. Anyone who tells you that you can't or shouldn't get the vaccine is really just injecting their opinion right now.The reason for the confusion is currently because there isn't a lot of data in pregnant or breastfeeding patients. There's no information that actually suggests harm in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers. There just isn't enough information to draw conclusions. Because of this lack of information the UK actually advises against vaccinating pregnant and breastfeeding patients until more information is available. But that advice isn't based on any known risk at this point.Notably we do actually have some scant evidence right now. There actually were pregnancies that happened incidentally in the trials even though they were supposed to be excluded. In the Pfizer study the vaccinated group saw **12 pregnancies and none were lost**. In contrast the **placebo arm had 11 babies and 2 were lost**. (source:  In the Moderna vaccine trial the **vaccinated group had 6 pregnancies with no losses**. Also **7 pregnancies happened in the placebo group and 2 losses occurred** (source:  These are small numbers for sure but it's the only hard data that we've got on the vaccine and pregnancies. It seems promising though and honestly it makes sense. There's no substantiated theory that suggests that the mRNA vaccines hurt babies. On the other hand sustained high-grade fevers from an illness are known to increase the risk of miscarriage. I'm guessing that's what happened in the placebo arm. As for breastfeeding... well we're in the same boat again about a lack of information. The **American College of Gynecology** recommends NOT withholding the vaccine purely because of pregnancy; they kinda just leave it up to the mom (source:  According to **ACIP guidelines in the U.S.** only two vaccines aren't allowed in breastfeeding patients - 1.) Smallpox and 2.) Yellow Fever. Every other approved vaccine out there is actually safe for breastfeeding patients (source: It's a hard choice for sure. I don't envy people who are carry babies or breastfeeding right now.Lastly I bummed a lot of these easy-to-read numbers from a coworker's Facebook feed.

Vaccines for SARS MERS and RSV have never been approved and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies) be they composed of protein viral vector DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).

Sure it could be something that may be a side effect but I am betting it's not. I don't subscribe to the conspiracy theories or even the idea this is experimental. They have been working on mRNA vaccines since the 70's. Just because they chose this route for vaccination doesn't make it some scary vaccine. They went this route because mass manufacturing and quick changes in the vaccine can be made. This gives them the ability to change things quickly enough to keep up with the changes in the virus.,BMalinois,2021-01-19 21:57:58+00:00,,0.494400352733686,0.1354497354497354,Positive,gjan79p,kx6u2z

l66iwf,Is anyone critical of the current UK vaccine rollout plan? A friend sparked a discussion on FB today about the comments in parliament suggesting teachers should be vaccinated as priority before schools return. I really want to hear other points of view on this. Boris said that they are sticking to the current rollout plan. I’d be interested to hear of any proposed simulations from doctorsscientists about how the virus is beaten between 1) vaccinating priority and high risk groups first (what we are currently doing) 2) vaccinating key workers first to begin to form herd immunity and prevent domino effect infections. But as far as I know there hasn’t been a great deal of discussion around that. It comes over as whether as a nation we wanted to stop the overall spread despite certain groups having a higher mortality rate or if we wanted to bring down the mortality rate immediately before reducing the spread through a partially vaccinated work force. I genuinely believe that the high risk groups being vaccinated first with social distancing and lockdown measures to reduce the spread is the best course of action socially. Purely because the mortality rate and further complications like covid-pneumonia should start to reduce once we see more people have their second dose. What do you think? Are we doing the right thing by prioritising clinically vulnerable adults first or should we have opted for key workers first to combat the overall spread? I saw last night people in the US going to Walgreens around closing time and they had a small surplus of vaccines left for the day and were able to give them to the general public (only eight of them though). Feels so surreal that folks in the US haven’t had the vaccine as long as we have but theirs is readily available to grab? I feel like if that were the case in the UK it would be absolutely manic and people would fight. (Reminds me of the first lockdown when supermarkets were bare).,smallersoul,2021-01-27 15:14:54+00:00,5.0,0.4367240797028031,0.1369587977034785,Positive,1,l66iwf
m4fpmp,Biology Question So I want to start off by saying that I am in no way an anti-vaccine person. I consider myself well educated for my age (16) and have recently stumped my AP Bio teacher with a question about the covid vaccine. So from my understanding of the vaccine from my teacher is that it is mRNA that is injected into us. This RNA then enters our cells and our ribosomes read and transcribe it into a spike protein. This protein is also a primary protein found on the COVID-19 envelope. When our body produces this protein and it leaves the cells our white blood cells find it and recognize it as a foreign invader. This begins an immune response that then is remembered for when the real virus enters the body and the white blood cells find it and recognize its spike proteins. Also recently learned in class was how viruses infect our cells. We learned that the proteins on the envelope (spike proteins for covid) are a sort of key to the lock that is a receptor on the outside of our cells. This “unlocking” allows the virus to enter and infect the cell. So my question is since our cells have the receptor for the spike protein there must be other molecules with the spike protein that our body uses and needs. So does the vaccine cause our immune system to also destroy these needed molecules as well as the virus therefore also harming us or is there other factors we were unable to cover in my class?,CurvyCommunist,2021-03-13 21:19:32+00:00,6.0,0.2865384615384615,-0.0365384615384615,Negative,1,m4fpmp

mg9inq,Covid Vaccine: Stool and Sweet Water tastebuds (TMI) So I got my 1st covid vaccine on Friday and today is Monday. I had my similar symptoms like chills &amp; a fever but during that I've also had a sweet taste to my water bottles. I had Covid (sars-COV2) late December &amp; tested negative in early-mid January and I remember my symptoms very well. Before I had covid I remember my water tasting ridiculously sweet. I didn't think much of it because sometimes I do get sweet tastes like in my breath tears etc (maybe im diabetic but I never got tested for diabetes or maybe its something else) Today I got that same taste in my water. I did have bad oral hygiene during my awful fever with the vaccine so after I brushed my teeth properly today the sweetness of the water faded a lot but it was still there at my tastebuds &amp; tonsils. (I can still taste and smell) Another thing I remember when having covid was the mucus in my stool (poop). But before covid I'd get mucus in my stool after intercourse (not anal just oral) &amp; I am clean from STDsI's. I felt like I had something that needed to come out but when I do its just discharge. I kept thinking maybe its from today's oral session. I'm very paranoid. I do understand this is a really new vaccine so there is a lot of unanswered questions &amp; symptoms. Does this happen to anyone else? Or maybe my body is just focused on something different?,Dismal-Act-7296,2021-03-30 06:19:22+00:00,0.0,0.4603269537480063,0.0054226475279106,Positive,1,mg9inq

My center had about a hundred people in it just while I was there for my appt and when the nurse was reading off the potential allergic reactions she said she hadn’t seen it happen at all since she started administering them in December. I took my epi pen with me just in case and sitting there thinking about it made me really light headed but somehow got through it! You can too if you choose to.

Not an enormous change but measurable.My T got a bit worse again after  2 (along with the typical 24 hr flu-like stuff) but it’s hard to tell if I’m back to baseline. It all may be due to systemic inflammation from the jabs because I really don’t think ototoxicity is very likely from a vaccine.Some others discussions about this that I’ve run across:Post covid vaccine tinnitus Modernity Second Dose ,Spairdale,2021-02-10 19:45:44+00:00,,0.4971500721500722,-0.0216089466089466,Negative,lgz7yt,lgz7yt

I know the MRNA vaccine is technically new but MRNA has been studied for a quite some time. Also many things contributed to a quick turn around time for these vaccines being lots of funding (which is not typical) plenty of eager participants (also not typical and can usually take a lot of time for recruitment) and simultaneously developingstudying and manufacturing. I do not feel as though they skimped on safety and the data is demonstrative of a vaccine that is safe and effective.

gn449bq,Please don’t stoop to insults it’s not a good look on anybody. It’s true that folks have developed birth control vaccines and that in the 70’s some researchers conjugated these vaccines with the tetanus vaccines. The article cites these scientific papers. Yet there are no actual scientific papers cited examining the controversial claim that the Kenya vaccine was laced with hcg. The scientists in the articles I posted claimed that the “hcg” signal was likely the result of some doctors pouring vaccine doses on birth control tests (at least that was what I inferred form their comments ) which is not a valid test for chg (nonspecific binding). I didn’t see anything about controls protocols etc. If you are able to find those articles I would be very interested to read them!Thanks,twelfthmoose,2021-02-12 23:15:41+00:00,,0.5861111111111111,0.1305555555555555,Positive,gmxduhh,lh4bdo

ghx84kk,The science behind this vaccine is so flawed it makes no since that your body should internally make something that a virus creates on its own it seems if your own immune cells are making the antigen of the virus the antibodies that are created from that will either be auto immune and attack the antigen your making or do nothing when the real virus comes. Your mingling this viral RNA with your immune system this is not a vaccine this is symbiosis with a virus you better trust your instincts and stop being a guinea pig. The people with no side effects don’t care about who dies or has bad reactions. The people who aren’t having reactions are gonna keep taking this vaccine annually and fill thier cells with so much viral rna thier gonna snap and possibly even mutate,Yeshua-is-king,2021-01-03 08:32:31+00:00,,0.5866666666666667,0.05,Positive,kni32j,kni32j

After waiting 15 mins at the site we left as told since I felt fine (thankfully I wasn’t driving) and I was mid-sentence talking about my day when I felt the panic unload on me like a ton of bricks. My partner was rightfully concerned but since it felt so much like a panic attack I didn’t think it was a reaction. I was suspicious but didn’t want to get in my head any more than I was already so I just used my calming tools and reassured myself that I was tired. Thankfully I calmed down relatively quickly but I still feel like it could creep back at any time. Its been a few hours and I definitely don’t feel great. I don’t feel quite dizzy more woozy I guess? But I feel very out of it as well as if I’m going through constant panic just at a lesser level. I have experienced dissociation in the past as well and it feels very similar. You all are certainly not alone. What you have described is exactly what I’m going through now. And it sucks but I’m thankful that we did. Please don’t be afraid to reach out! Whether it’s to me your loved ones or a provider it may benefit to have extra support for the next one.,Tie_East,2021-01-28 02:50:14+00:00,,0.4184179894179894,0.091058201058201,Positive,gjwt7q8,kxm587

gqiqnv1,Thanks for the award - will definitely let you know how the second one goes! It's in a couple of weeks. Glad you already have a premedication protocol. You can also add Benadryl 30-60 min before for extra protection but definitely check with your doctor first. Benadryl tends to be more effective than other antihistamines for acute episodes which is why it's one of the medications they administer via IV for anaphylactic reactions so it would be like bringing out the big guns to try and prevent a reaction. Just so you're aware almost everyone I've spoken to that's had the second vaccination of either this or moderna has said it was pretty intense. Almost everyone starting 4-12 hours after had flu like symptoms including fever that lasted about 24 hours. Some of these folks had autoimmune disorders others had no health conditions. So if you can try to be off work that might be a good idea.

gr08v93,Just my experience: I got vaccinated with Astrazeneca yesterday and I felt nothing when the doctor put the needle in. He talked to me softly squished my arm fat twice and then vaccinated me. I didn't feel a thing I had to look to see if it was actually done. Unfortunately I don't know what advice to give you for the needle phobia since luckily I don't have it but I can tell you that for me it didn't hurt a bit.Maybe also tell the person that vaccinates you. I had major anxiety but because I hate to loose control and basically getting a virus inserted in your body and you have to deal with the consequences then seemed like the worst for me.  So I told the doctor and he was extra super nice it seemed. He chatted a bit after with me I think to make sure that I wouldn't freak out. All people involved were really friendly and they know all of this gives most people anxiety. I'm sure you'll be alright! I know you have to get through the fear yourself but maybe knowing you're not alone helps a tiny bit.,Bajazuza,2021-03-15 12:42:21+00:00,,0.6248130341880341,0.0657652243589743,Positive,m4gcu2,m4gcu2

gmzvalu,"So your scientific paper has been retracted multiple times and is widely considered to be full of either problems or outright lies leading to it understandably being called a conspiracy theory. My favorite bit is that the lab that supposedly confirmed that these vaccines were secretly being used as racist population control had their license stripped for their testing being grossly inadequate and the authors of this paper didn't even feel the need to independently verify any of their results. I'll admit to not having read through the Moderna vaccine's FDA assessment but I have read Pfizer's. Per the very thing you linked severe adverse events occur in less than 1% of cases and ""occur in the general population at similar frequency as observed in the study.""

Given that I can't say ""No"" I have already taken the first shot. My question to the experts is: How to protect myself against any possible long-term side effects (such as cancer autoimmune diseases genetic disorders of my forthcoming children ... etc.)?For God's sake don't attack me or my ""paranoia"" of the vaccine or any such thing; this is getting really tedious and old.

n1da7z,Three weeks out from Johnson&amp;Johnson Vaccine My girlfriend and I (both 30 years old) got our J&amp;J shots together on the afternoon of April 6 and experienced all the usual side effects of chills headache fatigue etc. that are supposed to occur 1-3 days after the shot. While that part wasn’t fun it wasn’t a big deal.The issue however is that we’ve both felt mildly dizzy ever since. We’re still able to function work and go to the gym but it’s just a nagging dizziness feeling as if our equilibriums are slightly off. Also mildly fatigued on and off. This is not accompanied by shortness of breath headache leg pain or chest pain so I don’t think clotting is the issue. Scheduling a doctors appointment for next week regardless but is anyone else having long term effects from J&amp;J? Can’t find anything online about it.

gqkbeyr,Listen. Do not take any of these dangerous experimental Covid vaccines. Thousands of people are getting injured or worse murdered by this junk. You are young and therefore even if the Covid was still around which is debatable you would get mild symptoms and it would pass. It's not worth the huge risks of later pathogenic priming and immune reactions or worse. The mainstream media are telling you that getting the 'vaccine' which is really genetic modification technology would not prevent you getting Covid nor would it stop you spreading it so what's the point? All it can do is make symptoms more mild which is also not even for sure.Walk away while you can. There are countless that cannot do that but you still can.If you want proof check out the endless lists of injured and dead on the VAERS vaccine recording site.,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-11 11:55:10+00:00,,0.4833333333333333,0.0061111111111111,Positive,m2hfh5,m2hfh5

gnv07lu,I am not a doctor but I believe it may be partly related to the vaccine for two reasons. First they inject it into the muscle area which is in close proximity to the shoulderneck region. Do you remember if you had tensed your arm up prior to the shot or did you let it go like a dead weight? Depending on that it is possible to feel the entire region stiffsoreachy. The second reason some people get a reaction after the first shot which includes body aches stiffness etc. Thus joint pain is quite possible anywhere.I had my 1st shot on January 27th and only had some arm pain. Got my 2nd shot on February 16th and that one packed a punch. I developed a pretty high fever stiffness in the neckaches in the back chills a headache and arm pain. The fever chills and most of the stiffnessaches have gone away now. The only thing really bothersome at this point is a headache and soreness in the arm. After the 24-32 hour mark you start feeling better. Hopefully by tomorrow the rest has subsided.,Chris_NYU,2021-02-18 06:47:03+00:00,,0.4806140350877192,0.1057894736842105,Positive,lmdusb,lmdusb

The throat issue took a few more days. But I didn’t think about it too much more. Then two weeks later I got the second round (Friday).

Would my doctor be able to clarify this for me? Has anyone else in Texas been able to get the vaccine with a carcinoma in situ diagnosis?I am not looking for a loophole to get the vaccine. I would love to get it but don’t want to take it away from someone who needs it more than I do. I’m more interested in getting it because I have a newborn and want to lower my chances of infection for her sake.,thatswhatsgonnamake,2021-02-27 22:09:44+00:00,1.0,0.4979166666666667,0.35625,Positive,1,ltyjwe

gqstk36,Of course I don't know the actual numbers but it's no where close to the ridiculous figures given to the duped public. In that silly number they are not saying how many died WITH Covid being that anybody dying within 28 days of having a positive test (Important: PCR tests give 50%-70% false positives being run at 45 cycles in hospitals despite being instructed by the WHO not to exceed 25 cycles) gets labelled as a Covid death. The millions of unnecessary tests of asymptomatic persons getting false positives including old people who's immune systems are worse and are naturally more likely to show some some viral debris meant that people in that group who died would be recorded as having Covid.They are not saying how many of those people died of Covid from being hospitalized and given the wrong treatment or died from 'do not resuscitate' orders (Important: hospitals were paid fees for recorded Covid deaths as well as for putting people on ventilators) meaning they would have otherwise survived with the right treatment - CPAP etc Incentivized deaths.They are not accounting for the many who died from being neglected in care homes or who were falsely labelled as Covid for profit.How many of those deaths were from influenza which has mysteriously disappeared this Winter and been renamed as Covid? How many people died because people were given the false impression that hospitals were full to capacity and died of Covid or something else at home? Another important note is that post-mortems were not being done to see what these people were actually dying of. The people who are perpetrating this whole scamdemic pre-planned these micro-managed logistics.I could go on. My point it that there are countless ways and tricks to explain how those numbers have been deceptively reached.  This is far from the first time that such scams have been tried. This time they just were successful thanks to the immense media fear campaign and controlled media complicity:Incidentally the numbers of deaths worldwide and for most countries is no more than previous years. That's a smoking gun right there.,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-13 14:20:05+00:00,,0.5989371739371739,0.0845820845820845,Positive,gqs0clh,m23znk

gstsx88,I just got the J&amp;J with no side effects besides a sore arm and a slight fever last night.  I feel great today. I have done tons of research and this was the only vaccine I would consider. I did not want my sons to get the MRNA vaccines and they did it anyway. Both on first dose. I am also concerned about the placenta disruption from the MRNA vaccines.  The FDA has a site where they review the vaccines every few weeks. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines out of 150 pregnant women 29 had a spontanous miscarriages after the vaccines 1 still birth and some with vaginal bleeding. Do a search under FDA covid vaccines and their minutes of their meetings are on there. Under safety. Tinnitus may not be permanent. No one knows yet. Once you do the MRNA vaccine you have to keep doing them for the rest of your life as I am sure they will have to modify them for the variants. If forced to do a vaccine I would do J&amp;J.  I too was hesitant. I have not seen my sons in over a year as they live 1000 miles from me and I had to make a choice as I suffer from chronic back pain and cannot make a road trip that long without suffering. I got the shot 2 days ago and I only had a sore arm a slight fever last night and today I feel great.,Ellen1957,2021-03-30 18:21:12+00:00,,0.4305555555555556,0.1210227272727272,Positive,mfbziz,mfbziz

gqj9ex8,Thanks for your reply. Since you are studying viral immunology for covid 19 I have one more doubt. I heard that the vaccine protection only lasts between 3 to 6 months but scientists really don’t know for sure because there is no data. But let’s say for the purpose of this conversation it is 6 months. Let’s say someone gets the vaccine and 7 months pass by and at the 8th month mark they get COVID. Does this means that they can get as sick as someone that never was vaccinated? In the long term when the vaccine effectiveness goes away does this mean that vaccinated and unvaccinated people are in the same boat?,Accomplished-Board56,2021-03-11 04:48:14+00:00,,0.539836860670194,0.0359126984126983,Positive,gqj7m9p,m2hfh5

After being sent some pretty outrageous ""facts"" about the Pfizer vaccine with a link to the vaccine's disclosure document as 'proof' I actually did take the time to read through it- not a blog the actually Pfizer vaccine disclosure on the Pfizer site. Of course none of the terrible-horrible-no-good-verry-bad diseases that person was claiming were actual side effects. It was totally bogus claims with a legit link. I guess they assumed that nobody would read it and realize they were lying.

gt1sonm,Great question. Here’s what I found in [this article]( “Health information from states—including which vaccine was administered and where it was given—populates several CDC datasets used to track and coordinate vaccinations. Much of the data is stripped of personal identifiers pursuant to federal privacy laws.The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act provides Americans with privacy protections to ensure that health data stays confidential. But HIPAA as well as state-level medical records laws have carve-outs for public health entities—allowing them in many instances to share data without explicit patient permission.”,creativecoco1204,2021-04-01 16:59:24+00:00,,0.2595238095238095,0.2142857142857142,Positive,mhb1by,mhb1by

Too bad we couldn't test because the test was not available to us then. The same coworker recently finished her two doses of Pfizer and she experienced milder side effects from the second dose. For my first shot of Moderna I felt moderate fatigue body aches along with fevers that came and went. The feeling was very reminiscent of how I felt with the sickness back in Feb but mild and fairly tolerable compared to that. I get my second dose tomorrow and I'm quite curious how I'll feel.

giiffpb,Have you gotten the flu shot before? HPV? Rabies? Have you ever gotten « very bad side effects » as a result? I’m assuming no. Would you rather get the rabies vaccine or get rabies? If course the vaccine is a risk. But crossing the street is a risk. Walking inside a store is a risk. Putting your shoes on is a risk. Anything can happen. The risk of these said « very bad side effects » are far less than the risk of dying from COVID-19. I am pro choice. My body my choice. Yes. But this is a matter that is bigger than me. By vaccinating myself I am protecting my family my community and if everyone does that on a small scale we get this virus under control. Then no more lockdown. So stop it with your fake information about « a lot of people have very bad side effects ». The spread of this misinformation is killing people. There’s no other way to put it.

Even the COVID vaccines have been in people's bodies since March 2020 and no long term effects have been noted.     Now is it possible that something could happen down the line? Sure. But is it likely? No.     On the other hand long term effects of COVID are well established and very serious. Heart problems brain problems blood clots lung issues. All of these things are serious and could leave you crippled for life. Getting COVID is much much riskier than getting the vaccine.

It feels like you’re going to die while it’s happening and it’s a little embarrassing and dramatic but you feel better almost right away. It’s common and harmless as long as you don’t injure yourself falling. I concur with the other folks here recommending telling your doctor or nurse that you’re feeling anxious before hand and requesting to lie down. Other things that have helped me: eating a medium-sized salty meal beforehand to make your stomach feel full and settled and to keep your blood pressure regulated making sure you’re well-hydrated and trying to avoid getting shots when you’re feeling really tired early in the morning. And don’t look at the needle whatever you do! Best of luck with the second dose.,accidental_tourist_,2021-02-16 04:11:24+00:00,,0.4757495590828924,0.0546847442680775,Positive,lkhq3c,lkhq3c

lkvwrj,increased appetites? So I had my 2nd dose of Pfzier 3 weeks ago this coming Friday.  I noticed the day after my 2nd dose I was a little peckish (that means slightly hungry in the south but not hungry enough for a meal)  so I munch on a few nuts here and there.  Each day I have noticed my appetite increasing.  Not wanting the weight gain I drink a protein shake or something instead.  Today we are iced in and have had some power outages so I cooked today and tomorrow's dinner while i had power.  I found myself eating two servings of today's dinner (which is something I NEVER do) and then  a few hours later noshed a little on tomorrow dinner!!!  this is so NOT me.  Just wondering if anyone else have had an increase in their appetite since their 2nd dose of Pfzier.  My sister had her 2nd dose of Pfzier on Thursday and she said she noticed she is craving sweets every since the  day after the shot.

mfxgpp,Experience with first dose AstraZeneca vaccine Hello people since I was quite anxious before getting my first shot with Astrazeneca and found it very helpful to read through the posts in this subreddit I thought I'd share my experience as well.I got my first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine on the 14th of march at 1pm. Shortly after I got a headache which grew stronger towards nighttime so I took some paracetamol and it was alright.In the night I woke up with a higher temperature muscle pain and more headache. The first night was uncomfortable because of these symptoms and I didn't get much sleep. The next day the symptoms were still there and I got a fever. The second night I still had these reactions but I could sleep fine. In the morning the pain was mainly gone and my temperature was back to normal. Over the next hours I felt completely fine regarding temperature and the muscles.  I had a lingering headache (not really strong) for 8 days. The intensity changed but it didn't really dissapear in these days which also led me to being a little irritated and 'mushy' in the brain. I never experienced this kind of headache so I guess that it came from the vaccination. I think I could have treated it easily with pain killers but I didn't want to take them since I wanted to feel everything in case it would be getting worse (all this talk about the Brain Thrombose cases made me extra cautious). All in all it was not that bad I just wished the whole AstraZeneca discussion and the stopping of the vaccination didn't occur within the days I had reactions from it because besides fighting the reactions I also had to fight my anxiety. If you're reading this because you get the vaccination soon I wish you that everything goes well and that the reactions don't last for too long. And then of course that you're protected from covid which would be freaking awesome!,Bajazuza,2021-03-29 19:30:57+00:00,10.0,0.4505208333333333,0.0946614583333333,Positive,1,mfxgpp

gqgjh1l,So the only way to end a comunicable disease is to starve the virus of hosts. If it has no one to hop to it dies out. Some very vulnerable people are not able to get a vaccine. Therefore I’d say it is our duty to stop this virus by preventing it spreading whenever we can. That requires everyone who can to either seal themselves in at home 100% or to get a vaccine. It literally doesn’t work if we don’t do that. And guidance is very clear that vaccinated people still do wear masks to protect the unvaccinated.

gekh91u,Vaccines are a preventative measure. They are not a treatment.You don't take the flu vaccine after you get the flu that's why they have anti-virals like Tamiflu to take was you're infected.Same thing with HIV and  PrEP. Doctors don't give Truvada to people with active infections they give it to people as a preventative measure to avoid the infection. After they're infected they take a whole slew of other drugs to combat the infection.Treating active viral infections is difficult and anti-virals have a sketchy success rate because viruses tend to mutate rapidly. Typically most viral treatments end up just supporting the patient to get through the worst of the symptoms with as much comfort as possible.,kylefn,2020-12-04 05:55:47+00:00,,0.5386363636363636,-0.0401515151515151,Negative,jxaz32,jxaz32

gn2yd2f,"Thank   you for being the guinea pig to test a vaccine for us that has had  zero  studies about long-term effects zero studies about its effects on   fertility and pregnancies zero studies about if it even provides any   protection for longer than two months and that did bypass those usually   required studies with emergency admissions.To answer your question if you want to inform your family it helps not to lie but instead to give them the scientific studies that the vaccine developers made - remember that some people want actual sources and don't just follow like sheeple - here they are hosted on a government website:Pfizer: [Moderna: [In   the Pfizer document the immediate adverse events are in the table   starting at page 35. With ""Severe"" meaning that you aren't able to do   daily activities (aka go to work) when marked with (a) and requires at   least intravenous hydration when marked with (b).So   with the first dose you will have about a 2 to 3% chance of having   severe reaction and a 27% chance that you experience pain that requires   you to take pain medication. The second dose is much more brutal with 5   to 10% for sever reactions and 45% requiring pain medication.It   has a 10 to 20 times higher rate of adverse events than established   vaccinations that did go through the required studies like the Tetanus   or Hepatitis vaccine.

We ingest these chemicals besides the MRNA in other foods all the time. Again- people don’t understand science and latch onto things they think are scary. These are normal- everyday things that we just don’t think about all the time so when it’s injected instead of ingested people freak out. People with disabilities aren’t going to have different side effects long term because they can’t. Vaccines do not linger in the system.   We can guarantee that because we’ve done studies and tests and have decades worth of data that shows there are no long term side effects that show up randomly from vaccines.  All side effects happen quickly. If people with disabilities have a risk- they talk to their doctors about it- but the risk is immediate side effects. Not long term. If you’re concerned about people who can’t take the vaccine  because of a disability- it’s another reason to get vaccinated.

gmpg9t2,Hi- Epidemiologist here. As a nurse please don’t encourage others not to get the vaccine. We get the flu shot every year to protect ourselves and others from the flu. Plenty of healthy young people have died from the virus. It has already been advised that pregnant people do not get vaccinated because the pregnant people are more susceptible to illness poor reactions. etc. We need healthy people to take the vaccine in order to protect those who can’t get the vaccine (herd immunity). However herd immunity will never be achieved if only older people get the vaccine.No these deaths shouldn’t be happening but to assume that everyone under 75 will handle the virus without any issues is an ignorant statement. These vaccines have to go through multiple stages of trials before being given to the public to test for safety.There is no way to get the country back to normal unless we get as many people vaccinated as possible. This is not only to protect ourselves but to protect those who can’t get the vaccine due to KNOWN underlying health issues or conditions.,ladymemedaddy,2021-02-09 15:39:22+00:00,,0.4955882352941176,0.1504901960784313,Positive,gmotjsx,lfky5h

gizgtje,I faced essentially the same type of ethicalmoral decision for me and my family.  I received the vaccine on saturday.Nobody can make this choice for you but I can tell you why I made the decision I did.  I am living in a failed country for covid control.  I am living in a country with a failed system for vaccine distribution.  I am living in a country with no equitable healthcare where those of money and influence and of some races more than others receive a higher standard of care.  I would prefer my government had a fair way to allocate vaccines but the reality here is that it is fair only at the most superficial level.  Those in charge vaccinated themselves first.  Celebrities and people of power have gotten vaccines.  People with the resources of time money freedom to travel and technological resource have gotten vaccinated ahead of those less capable and fortunate.   And the system beyond that has turned into a mix of luck and persistence.  And then there are the masses of everyone else left to wait for unknown months regardless of circumstance. Do I feel I have crossed a moral or ethical line?  Maybe I have in the desire to protect my children my parents and yes even myself.  If your moral character is more important to yourself than the life of your child and you are trusting the government to make choices to protect you despite their clear lack of competence and moral character themselves I applaud your character but not your parenting.  Do I think I made the right decision? 100%.,dj8675308,2021-01-12 09:28:15+00:00,,0.4477619047619047,0.1487619047619047,Positive,kupj2u,kupj2u

Day 3 no symptoms and soreness gone. Day 4 I woke up at 1am with a fast pulse of 130 bpm. After that Ive been good.

lo7vyj,Vertigo and vaccine 5 days after my first Pfizer vaccine I started getting small waves of dizziness. 3 days after that they became severe and the vomiting started. It was so bad I could not even stand up and could not stop throwing up. Husband actually had to call 911! Was admitted and given fluids and anti nausea. I could not even open my eyes for 2 days without throwing up. Cat scan. MRI blood work all ok. Dr said could very well be vertigo brought on by vaccine even though no live virus in vaccine your body doesn't know that. There is a viral type of vertigo. Went for second vaccine since doc said better than getting covid. I actually had two days feeling better after 2nd shot but now back to waves of dizziness but thankfully no nausea. Some episodes put me in bed bad ringing in ears and feeling like crap. Tinnitus is constant but gets worse with bad dizzy spells. Doc prescribed Meclizine but it makes me feel worse and does nothing for dizziness.It's been a month of this now! Very difficult to work. Can't even walk the dog! I spend most of my day working in bed on my laptop. I just try to cram everything I need to do in between waves. I'm pretty tough and have been fighting through but it is really getting hard not to cry! To top it all off I am also packing the house to move next week 18 hrs away! Can't even drive so hubby will have to take full brunt. Anyone else having this severe dizziness?

gqevxyy,Hi thanks for reaching out and providing your insight. I was getting tested regularly by the vaccine study. However my initial positive test came from a drive through swab provided free by the city. I had some potential exposure a week prior and was being safe to make sure of my status. The positive test was confirmed 3 days later by my scheduled test with the trial. I’m aware of the current trials for effectiveness of mixing vaccines and hope they prove effective. I am also in continuing contact with the study physician and staff as I know the wheels turn slowly. I am currently not overly concerned with my health as I have antibodies and the first dose. I would like a 2nd dose for longer term peace of mind. I also am concerned about acquiring clear and approved documentation which might be difficult if I get shots from 2 different sources.,johnocomedy,2021-03-10 04:35:45+00:00,,0.4630184630184629,0.1502164502164502,Positive,gqem7d2,m1jnwf

I received the dose at around 1:30pm yesterday in my upper left arm. It was slightly more painful that a typical flu shot but nothing too discomforting.When I woke up this morning it reminded me of what it felt like the day after getting hit with a pitch in little league lol. I did some stretching and it has now settled to a minor dull painsoreness. No other side effects aside from that! I'll post again to update on any changes in symptoms and also when I receive my second dose.

gszx3nr,"You personally are probably at low risk and I understand what you're saying.  There has to be a compelling risk vs reward calculation in order for you to inject something into your body.  If you're young and healthy I agree that you should be able to make your own risk assessment and that you shouldn't be forced to get a vaccine.I will not try to convince you to get the mRNA vaccines.  I personally did not get either.  And if you're like some members of my family who cannot get vaccines due to extreme allergies to them don't get a vaccine.  I got the Johnson and Johnson shot.  The main reason I did so is financial.  I teach high school and while my district doesn't require us to get the vaccine we will not be required to quarantine if we do get it (even if we've already had COVID - which I have).  We have a limited number of special ""COVID days"" available for us to use currently if we have to quarantine ourselves but once those are used up and going forward if I am forced to quarantine again I will have to use up my sick days which represent a monetary value to me of $200 apiece.  Is there some potential risk here?  Sure probably way less than the more experimental mRNA vaccines but still some risk.  I figure the risk of an Adenovirus vaccine is relatively low for the vast majority of the population - we've been working with them since the 70s.But I've done risky things for money before; I've worked on a commercial fishing boat on Lake Superior in November and I've worked as a contractor in the nuclear industry where I was exposed to a higher than normal radiation dose for a few years.  I made good money doing both and I estimate that the risks from both of those jobs far outweigh the risks of an Adenovirus based vaccine.In summary there may be a significant financial benefit to getting the vaccine (in particular the J&amp;J version) compared to a relatively low risk.It may also be possible that even if you've had COVID a vaccine could help build more efficient antibodies - a human body can make around 10^(12) different kinds of antibody molecules.  When your body encounters a full on virus it does the best it can to make antibodies to counter it.  In principle the vaccine exposes us to a protein that basically tells your body the most efficient antibody to make to fight that virus.  There could be some value there.And finally we don't know if these vaccines provide sterilizing immunity but if they do the more people who are vaccinated the less this virus will spread and the less rationale corrupt politicians will have to keep us locked down.",Iglujjuaq,2021-04-01 04:48:18+00:00,,0.4888406473700593,0.1271413009648303,Positive,mhf98n,mhf98n

gr54xeo,Yes all the misinformation you just mentioned. 1. All of the authorized vaccines have been demonstrated to be 100% effective against hospitalization and death from COVID and very effective against developing a severe case. 2. The available vaccines do offer a great deal of protecting from developing symptomatic COVID. That’s what the 94 to 95% efficacy from Pfizer and Moderna means. 3. There is growing evidence that the vaccines reduce transmission though it’s not close to 100%. That’s why masks are still essential when such a small portion of the population has been vaccinated: 4. No death following vaccination has been proven to have been caused by the COVID vaccines. Not a single one and each of those deaths is reported and investigated. 5. VAERS reports are not verified to have been events caused by the vaccine. There’s a clear disclaimer on the VAERS website to that effect that you and other anti-vaxxers ignored.,ShenhuaMan,2021-03-16 17:11:14+00:00,,0.4747835497835498,0.2127922077922077,Positive,gr53xj5,m6blm2

gqsmlvx,The most common adverse effects are discomfort or pain at the injection site and feeling a bit under the weather for a couple of days. For those that get COVID in the developed world the hospitalization rate is around 20% and half of those wind up in the ICU. Even the least effective vaccine has entirely eliminated both death and hospitalization from COVID and the severe adverse events rate during the clinical trials for the test group was 0.6% vs. 0.5% for the control group. With 66 million Americans apparently having received one dose the difference between 0.6% and 0.5% is 6600 people. An estimated 28.8 million people in the US have had COVID over the past year and around 532k of them (1.85%) have died. Clearly the risk-reward is on the side of getting vaccinated especially if you have one or more comorbidities or barring that if your genetics put you at risk. At the very least you should check your SNPs before deciding not a vaccinate and earn your immunity through infection instead just to make sure you're not at increase susceptibility. The idea of dying of something you could have very easily prevented sucks but certainly some people will choose it.,ChoiceEcon,2021-03-13 12:59:40+00:00,,0.5326657329598506,0.0835854341736694,Positive,gqohmi5,m38xhp

gss47nl,Pfizer’s second dose is most effective at 21 days after the first dose. I’ve also been reading up on this and by the second week the first shot is at its full efficacy. That’s approx 80% from what I gather. I’m a nobody so this is truly a guess but your sister will probably be fine regardless. Now if she has the ability to wait a week that would follow the CDC guidelines and likely be her best bet if she wants to receive the full benefits of the vaccine. With all that said she should definitely consult a licensed medical professional. Alternately the person who said to come back after two weeks may have meant to check back in 2 weeks to make an appointment for the following week. Most places won’t make appointments very far in advance so perhaps that’s it. And finally if the place is insisting she get the second shot two weeks after the first you may want to report that location for not following FDACDC guidelines and perhaps see if she can get her second dose somewhere else. Most places are giving priority to second doses. Best of luck to her!,tinyspacebee,2021-03-30 08:29:23+00:00,,0.3241379310344827,0.2205747126436781,Positive,mga0iv,mga0iv

l38wd8,2nd Moderna Shot Compared to 1st Hey everyone!Just got my first Moderna shot about 3 weeks ago. I felt very ill after the first shot. Got the usual flushing pins and needles chills muscle aches headache insomnia and sore arm. My temp was very high for about 72 hours and I experienced auditory hallucinations for about 2 hours. I do not have a psychiatric illness. It all cleared as quickly as it came on. My question is targeted to people who had similar intense reactions to the first dose. Was it worse when you got your second? How much worse?I felt like I was on my deathbed there for a few days and I just can't imagine how the second dose can be worse :(,pandives,2021-01-23 09:09:45+00:00,15.0,0.4584444444444444,-0.0088148148148148,Negative,1,l38wd8

Your mingling this viral RNA with your immune system this is not a vaccine this is symbiosis with a virus you better trust your instincts and stop being a guinea pig.

I wasn't going to register for one but I decided to since there were still available appointments. However after scheduling the appointment I realized that I don't necessarily fall into the categories that allow me to get the vaccine.

l8v8k5,concerned about grandmother—2nd shot symptom? My grandmother got her 2nd vaccine dose about 30 hours ago. I’m not sure whether it was Pfizer or Moderna but it was one of the two. She’s about 75 I think no major medical issues that I’m aware of. She couldn’t sleep that night (that was the night before last she took melatonin last night and got a lot of sleep). Today we were driving and when we got home she sat in the car for about 10 minutes sweating profusely. She was complaining about nausea about 30 minutes before that (we had ice cream so she chalked it up to being mildly lactose intolerant). I assume nausea isn’t that bad of a symptom but almost faintingpassing out worried me a bit especially since she had just been driving. Is this a relatively common symptom andor something I shouldn’t be concerned about? I’d like her to call a doctor but she isn’t the type to be worried about this stuff. It’s also possible she just overheated but I’d rather be safe than sorry so I figured I would make a post here.

I have many ineligible patients somehow securing the vaccine while my state tells me there is a shortage?

gpi1ok7,"I do NOT live in North Dakota but this guide is really easy to understand. I tried looking into the above comment but everything I read was very heavy and I couldn't understand it until I found the PDF I linked. I skipped the things specific to ND but found the rest helpful. [This guide]( also points out who might be in higher risk group and maybe consider personal factors of the vaccine like breastfeeding or allergies. It's really balanced and informative. Basically syncytin-1 has to do with placenta and the fear is the vaccine since it interacts with this a little can stop placenta production causing sterilization. The guide points out that if the vaccine did have enough impact to cause interference with placenta production covid would have the same risk factors. The guide mentions a few places that studies and data collection is still needed for many aspects but what data is known appears safe.EDIT to note: I thought the link would display the same info google showed.

gppo440,I would say it sounds typical of 50% of people I know. The other 50% were just extremely tired with a sore arm. However there are a very small percent that have an allergic reaction but it’s rare. But I’d keep an eye out for allergic symptoms. If not she’s building immunity by feeling ill. The body is working really hard right now to create antibodies and that makes some of us feel bad as if we were sick. So feeling ill is actually a good sign unless something goes terribly wrong. Glad to help. It’s nice to see you care for your mom...she will do the same for you when you get your chance to be vaccinated. Soup and tea would most certainly cheer her up.

gpizf57,I would have not gotten the vaccine since you have just had covid.  You are immune from it 6 months to a year. People seem to react more severely from the vaccine when they have already had covid.  The MRNA vaccine does not protect you from the variants from Britain and S. Africa. If this is your first dose.  OMG - the second is supposed to have more side effects. You can still get covid with the vaccine and still pass it to people.  It is only supposed to keep you from getting severe covid. Good luck.  You should have done more research before you took the shot. It is experimental and not approved by the FDA yet. It's emergency use only. I am not an antivaxxer. I get my flu shots annually but will not get the MRNA vaccine.  Too many unknowns with it.,Ellen1957,2021-03-03 12:31:46+00:00,,0.5333333333333333,0.305,Positive,lwpytn,lwpytn

It's likely the people on the ground in the clinics are just confused by what you're trying to accomplish and they're saying no because it's too far outside of their comfort zone  action plan.  I understand the reasons you're hearing from the clinics don't make sense but there's nothing we can do to change what the people in the clinics believe. You have to wait them out for them to have updated information which may take months (it takes time to train people).    If you're being told you cannot schedule a second dose at a site you've never been to I would suggest trying to get back to the state where he got his first dose if possible.

lpsnmu,First Hand Experience Pfizer and Moderna Vaccines are working well. Over the last 6 weeks a handful of family members were able to get vaccinated. It was a mix of Pfizer and Moderna. Recently two elderly members of my family a couple aged in their late 90s both died in a few days of one another. At first we all thought it was a fairy tale type of thing. They would only spend a few days without each other. The family was heavily together during this time with little to no protection in terms of masks. Just for some context these grandparents had both been ill with live in nurses for a very long time so they were frail which is why when they died and did so with respiratory distress no one suspected it was Covid.Fast forward a week and two of the nurses and 5 members of the family have Covid. Reflecting on the breathing issues both elderly family members had at the end it is probable they both died of Covid as well.So far all the infected are doing okay. The positive if you can call it that in all this mess is anyone who was vaccinated has zero symptoms nothing at all. So that's a good test of the vax in real life.,jonika_axleom,2021-02-22 16:26:32+00:00,1.0,0.469263085399449,0.0368698347107437,Positive,1,lpsnmu

n2uhz2,Pfizer 1st shot - anxious person Hi allI just got my 1st Covid shot (Pfizer) and wanted to post my experience. I am a very anxious person I have been battling generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks for 13+ years. Part of my disorder is a very severe health anxietyhypochondria. Prior to scheduling my dose and the days leading up to it I went on Google and on here to see others' experiences. Seeing good stories helps ease my fears. However I noticed that a lot of the stories were from those folks who didn't have a good time (sorry guys! Not fun!!) and barely any were of goodpositive experiences. So i want to put mine here to give hope to anyone like I was... so far its gone fine.427: scheduled my appointment for 1st and 2nd doses after months of avoiding it. Took an hour to decide the best time and day to do it to allow me time to recover from my anxiety without any obligations. Took minutes to actually schedule and was able to see which vaccine brand was available where (i did cvs; was nervous about j&amp;j and moderna). 1010427-430: my nervous tick was back. Between the anxiety of knowing I had it scheduled the anxiety of finals coming up in a week and the anxiety that ways comes right before my time-of-the-month. But was able to manage it. Have been drinking tons of water for the last 4 days so much so that my pee has been straw-colored to clear. Not drowning in water but drinking it steadily throughout each day.  91051: the day arrived. I worked a double today so I was able to distract myself. Had 2 great shifts so I was in a great mood. Then the shift got closer to the end and I knew my appt time was nearing. Began to have a nervous stomach (the shits). Not fun but manageable. 81051: 4:00pm got home from work. Ate lunch drank tons of water. Had absoluty no appetite. The panic attack starts. At this point slightly elevated heart rate cold sweats slightly shaky can't focus and irritable. But used to this feeling. 81051: 4:55 pm we head out the door to cvs. The panic attack slowly increases. I had my boyfriend drive me because i knew it would be safer. 810 because I know this is JUST panic51: 5:13 pm we are 2 minutes away. Dry mouth sets in. 71051: 5:15 pm we get into cvs. I start crying from the panic attack. Luckily my bf is there to help check me in and hold my hand. The woman checking me in is SUPER nice when she sees me crying. 7.51051: 5:20 pm I sit down for my shot. I am so thankful that I was seated with an RN (was happy to have a med professional and not just a tech or student) there and she was a psych RN for 20 years. I felt calm with her but panic attack was still there. She asked me the regular questions: name dob allergies. I have allergies to 2 meds so she tells me ill stay there for 30 mins (so happy). I'm shaking heart is racing crying lightheaded legs shaking. 510 for the panic attack but 1410 for the nurse51: 5:25 pm she has me turn away so I don't see it. She gives me the shot. The shot itself feels like getting any vaccine. 101051: 5:26 pm my panic attack immediately gets worse. Again just a panic attack because I've felt all these symptoms before AND right before I got the shot. No change in symptoms just heightened. Shaky legs and hands shaky chest lightheaded short of breath racing heart fear 61051: 5:26-5:40 pm the nurse is so kind and my boyfriend rubs my back and his hand on my knee to keep me grounded (it works guys!!). She just has conversation to keep my mind off the panic while waiting for it to finish. She has me sitting on the ground. Let's me take my mask off to eat a Granola bar that I had in my purse. Drinking tons of water. 71051: 5:45 pm start to feel better. She has me walk around. I feel immediately nauseas so I sit back down. It's from the panic eating and chugging water. I spit up a bit then feel better. 81051: 5:50 pm I'm able to sit in a chair. I get up to pee. Making the walk to the bathroom and using the bathroom helps. Something about the act of urinating sometimes feels like I'm washing out my panic. 8.51051: 6:30 pm we get home. Feels good to finally be home. I lay in bed. Arm is just now starting to be sore just like with my flu shot so nothing extreme. Feels like I got punched by a human (have seen people say they felt like they were punched by a horse lol). 91051: 630-7:40 pm have been laying in bed since I got home. I have frasier playing in the background to distract my thoughts. Scrolling through pinterest to soothe my thoughts. Have peed like 4 times already (I had a lot of water). Bored but enjoying time to lay down with no obligations. Might get delivery for dinner. No headache yet. 9.510WILL UPDATE AS THE DAY GOES ON Tl;dr - have a history of anxiety and panic attacks. Had my 1st dose on 51 @ 5:15 pm. So far have only had panic attack before the shot that was heightened immediately after. Went away within the hour. Only slight soreness can still use my arm.**tip: get at the end of the day or on a day you have nothing to do**tip: get in the arm you don't sleep on!!

Take my situation for reference: I struggled so much to find a job after graduation and the only job I got I got because my (current) boss took a gamble on me. So technically I owe my boss my job. A few weeks into my current job I was almost fired because a coworker fabricated an incident report about me and only my boss stood by my side. So by all means I owe my boss my job.  Now a few days ago my boss called me in person and said: ""Hey we're vaccinating our whole team against Covid. I want you to be vaccinated (my name) what time suits you best? Monday morning or Tuesday noon?""... What do you think? Do you think I had the choice to say ""No""? Probably yes. But at what price! So I said ""Okay Monday is fine.""

That’s where your efficacy question comes into play — it is safe to say that the vaccine is 95% effective at keeping you out of the hospital and from dying...Not immune but safe from the very deadly symptoms that people who are unvaccinated are experiencing.,thehandpirate,2021-01-04 03:00:43+00:00,,0.5800000000000001,0.335,Positive,gi04iry,kpq1af

gncf8a0,I take ibuprofen everyday for chronic pain. I took it 8 hrs before my first dose because the CDC wasn’t advising against it yet. For my second dose I didn’t take ibuprofen for 24 hrs before. However I think by “before” they just mean right before (i.e. 30 minutes before) the vaccine with the purpose of preventing any symptoms. The studies on this are very vague and only some studies show that taking pain meds before a vaccine effects the immune response. the studies looking at pain meds taken after the vaccine to relieve symptoms showed no change in immune response. All of these studies looked at other vaccines (not the covid vaccine) hence why they’re recommending to avoid pain meds before the vaccine just as a precaution until there’s more data.,1736479,2021-02-14 03:35:39+00:00,,0.5201719576719577,-0.0279761904761904,Negative,gnceu83,ljae37

If you want to get the vaccine a Reddit group of people posting about their experience shouldn’t stop you. Talk to your friends. Family. Doctor. Gather there feedback and experiences. If someone wants to come on here and say it’s the best or they want to say it’s the worst Both of those should be ok. If someone wants to talk conspiracies that should be ok too. Take it with a grain of salt. Read and learn and make your own educated decisions. If you want to abandon the Reddit group. Cool. Just abandon it. No need to write up a post declaring it and getting others on your side.,Careless_Option_5327,2021-03-16 16:52:38+00:00,,0.5916666666666667,0.2173076923076923,Positive,m6blm2,m6blm2

gr0qb4r,Hi! I want to preface this with I feel so lucky to have received that J&amp;J vaccine as I work in the healthcare sector and I believe getting a vaccine is way better than gettingspreading covid.I am a 20 year old female college student. I received the vaccine at 1pm this past Saturday. I felt no side effects until about 6-7pm. I started to get chills and felt a fever coming on. I kept shivering a feeling really really cold. However I did not take any tylenolparacetamol at this point so my fever kept increasing (wanted to wait my fever out as long as I could to not interfere with my immune response). By about 11pm my fever spiked to 102-103 degrees F (was not aware it was this high as I had yet to formally take my temperature). I was with family who helped me but ended up passing out as I was walking to get water (probably because I let my fever get so high). Took two 325 mg Tylenol and fever came down to 100 degrees F and felt much betterwas able to sleep. The next day was a lot better and I took a tylenol once every 5 hours to keep my fever around 99-100 degrees F. Today I am feeling MUCH better. No fever just minor jointbody aches and soreness in my arm. I don't really have any lymph node swelling or anything.I heard from my friends (also ~20 years old) that we all had the same response. Good thing is that means our immune systems were *definitely* activated. Although this was unpleasant it was WAY better than getting covid or spreading covid.TLDR: Felt like a 2 day bad flu. Be prepared to take advil or tylenol to postmedicate.,allie2274,2021-03-15 15:18:10+00:00,,0.4294222222222222,0.0749111111111111,Positive,m5lk8m,m5lk8m

gqipn9q,Having friends and family in medical I have had multiple opportunities to “jump the line”. — whether notice on day of appointment availability  (which are open to all adults for that day) or other more dishonestnepotistic ways to circumvent the restrictions.As a fairly low risk individual it would be wrong both morally and ethnically. So instead of even considering anything like that I signed up on a quick reaction standby list for vaccines that are soon to expire. That way I wasn’t taking someone’s dose but happy to rush over there if it’s getting trashed. I made clear to the clinic I was low-ish risk and to put me at the bottom (history of smoking). Karma rewarded that decision within 48 hours. At the end of the day you have to live with yourself and your decisions.

lsbj19,Question: My grandma is 102 years old. She is also very thin &amp; weak. Should she get the Covid vaccine in your personal opinion? It is unlikely she would survive a covid-19 infection. However she is really struggling with the social distancing (e.g. her dementia has significantly progressed within the last year and her quality of life seems to have declined). My family still sees her via facetimecomputer and sitting in the kitchen while she's in the living room but it's difficult for her. However everyone is adamant about her health and safety and no one wants to be the cause of her death obviously but it seems to be at the expense of her happiness. I'm sure this is an issue that other families are facing. The inflammatory response that can happen as a side effect seems more common in younger people but I'm also not sure what would happen to my grandma if she had a fever myalgias etc. I'm not sure what her body could tolerate. I would appreciate if you might add your reasons evidence qualifications (NAD=not a doctor vs. DAPMD=definitely a practicing medical doctor) andor if it's just a hunch or feeling. **I understand that I'm asking reddit and not a physician.** I would really like to hear opinions as well as anecdotal evidence.

My mom and her colleagues recently got their 2nd dose of Pfizer and many experienced fatigue and headaches that went away with thin 2 days. No way to tell how you will react but vast majority are experiencing mildmoderate symptoms. Good luck,thingsiwant2do,2021-03-11 08:24:14+00:00,,0.4544117647058823,0.1801470588235294,Positive,m2hc6c,m2hc6c
glcohde,Got pregnant weren’t already pregnant. Also 12 people aren’t exactly a good sample size for the entire USA. So guess the OP’s question is answered but the outcome of the children’s health isn’t. The reason some of the trials take so long is the long term effects. I had to get it because of where I work but I wasn’t happy about it. Hopefully we won’t get those “Did you or your loved one get the un-approved Covid-19 vaccine? You might be entitled to compensation”.,Fuglie_Gamer,2021-01-30 09:06:21+00:00,,0.603125,0.3458333333333333,Positive,glco2ul,l7x54a
