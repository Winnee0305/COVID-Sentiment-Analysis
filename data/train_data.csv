lx3h26,Pain &amp; Swelling (AZ Vaccine UK) I got my first dose of the Astra Zenica vaccine on Saturday morning. Was fine all weekend bit of tenderness in my arm but it had almost gone by Sunday evening. Monday night I woke up with horrendous pain in my arm and it's been getting worse as the days have gone on. I now have a big red mark and swollen lump on my arm. Can barely move my arm without searing pain from my shoulder to just below my elbow. Even just the fabric of my t-shirt touching it is painful. Anyone else experienced anything like this? I have no known allergies &amp; have never reacted to any vaccine in my arm like this previously.,pupperinofloof,2021-03-03 20:26:10+00:00,4.0,0.41,0.075,Positive,1,lx3h26

The FDA and Health Canada have not yet granted general approval for any COVID vaccine.Personally I'm in a low-risk group (not obese or elderly) and I'm pretty sure I've already had COVID. I'm going to wait for now to see if people voluntarily taking the vaccine develop side effects. I'd like to see the FDA approve one of the vaccines and disclose what side effects they expect could be experienced by people using them. In the meantime I've acquired a variety of treatments that I will keep on hand and take whenif I develop symptoms again.,nineteen_fifty,2021-03-09 15:39:17+00:00,,0.8577777777777778,0.32,Positive,m0ydsy,m0ydsy

lq14qq,COVID Vaccine Hesitation Disclaimer: Not anti-vax and I wear my mask inside whenever required.  Hey all scheduled to get my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow.  Not anti-vax at all just conflicted on a few things.  How do we know that there will be no long term side effects down the road? Say 6 months 1 year 2 years or even further.  I’m a very fit and healthy person in my 30s with no prior medical history so I’m really not at risk for any serious COVID complications. I have no immediate family nearby.  What’s the reasoning to get it? The at risk population will all be vaccinated by the time my area starts opening back up.  Again not anti-vax just looking for a non-biased honest answer and conversation. Thanks in advance.,DutchsChoppa,2021-02-22 21:56:10+00:00,16.0,0.3292063492063492,0.0932936507936508,Positive,1,lq14qq
gwxq0nr,Had my J&amp;J shot April 5th. Started having Charlie horse like feeling in my calf early the next week that lasted close to a week. Shortly after my knee started swelling and hurting. Yesterday I had a positive D dimer test but no blood clot was found on the ultrasound of my leg (by some girl who didn't even cover me up and left the door half open!) so I was sent home and told the positive could still be from getting the shot and that the leg pain is likely a side effect from the vaccine??? I was advised to get a compression sock. I have zero other risk factors for blood clots and had no issues with vascular narrowing prior to this.,ulteriormotives3,2021-05-04 19:12:38+00:00,,0.3393250688705234,0.0238980716253443,Positive,n1da7z,n1da7z

kw1ukc,Had a mild reaction the day after my first dose of the moderna vaccine. Pics included Received my first vaccine on Thursday 17. No problems the rest of the day. Friday morning 18  I woke up feeling fine but noticed on my shuffle to the coffee maker that my right forearm was itchy. Pulled back my sleeve to see tiny raised hives. Checked lefty yep hives. I was a little sore in my left upper arm where I got the shot but no redness or swelling around the injection site. Took ibuprofen and 2 benadryl. Soreness got much better but my little red friends got a little more fiesty looking after 2 hours. They didn't seem to spread any further than my lower arms and once I kept my sleeves off of them the itching was way better. By Saturday they were still hanging around but definitely diminished. I am highly allergic to cephalosporin based antibiotics (penicillin and all of its friends). I felt fine throughout the weekend and my reaction never got any worse. I just wanted to give anyone with a strong allergic reaction to cephalosporins a heads up. My doctor says that for my second dose I'll take benadryl ahead of time and be monitored for awhile longer at the clinic as a precaution.(,ginniper,2021-01-12 22:00:48+00:00,1.0,0.3945962732919255,0.1340527950310558,Positive,1,kw1ukc

gt5j4ew,Ok here’s at least a link to the European reporting site for current adverse effects of the 4 vaccines. Although there have been dozens of miscarriages reported  the on-line mob went to work trying to discredit what had been included on the European report. However at the same time our own CDC recommends this report as one source for obstetricians to get info to help them decide on whether to recommend their patients get vaccinated. I also want to add that the WHO whether you believe them or not made a statement on January 8 that they did not recommend pregnant women get the vaccine. Of course they also stated that a 3’ distance was adequate distance...and the US ignored that as well. I will continue to search for the study that confirms my support of women saying no to these vaccines.  ,Rabbik2020,2021-04-02 16:13:53+00:00,,0.362037037037037,0.1629629629629629,Positive,gt2z1ir,mfbziz

gi3pfft,Yes sort of. The spike proteins do appear on your cells after they synthesize it from the mRNA but the immune response isn’t to the cell itself but rather the spikes. What you’re describing where the body attacks the entire cell is the textbook definition of a primary immune deficiency which is where the body makes antibodies to itself. In the case with the mRNA and your cells with newly minted spike proteins the immune response is to the spikes not the cells. Plus even though some of your cells now have spikes the instructions on how to build those spikes is not genetically passed on during cell division so in that way the spikes never become a permanent fixture of your cellular structure so the primary immune deficiency you’re describing won’t happen. mRNA research is decades old. A lot of very smart very accomplished people have studied this for years and are staking their professional reputations on the line that this technology and these vaccines will work and are safe for the general public.Some people may be allergic to the compounds used to create the suspension. That happens but on a global basis these are exceedingly rare and in the vast vast vast majority of cases are not life threatening allergic reactions.,NotQuiteStableGenius,2021-01-04 20:14:44+00:00,,0.5843506493506493,0.1683290043290043,Positive,gi3n6xs,kqd81v

But right now we’re not sure if vaccinated people don’t spread the virus. Right now we think that vaccinated people could still spread the virus asymptotically.

gfe6gs6,&gt; Fact is Pfizer don’t know if the vaccine is effective how long it is effective for and what the potential side effects areNot quite true.Pfizer do know how effective it is. Indeed so does the MHRA in the UK the FDA in the US knows how effective it is the EMA in Europe are still reviewing the data (and have been doing so throughout the Phase 3 process getting almost real-time updates on this) and several NITAGs around the world have seen at least the Phase 1 and 2 data. The efficacy of the vaccine up to two months is not in doubt.We don't know how long the duration of protection lasts indeed but that's for a number of reasons. (1) The vaccine recipients in the trials only got their doses several months ago so that's how long our data go back and (2) it depends on the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and how much it mutates in the future. So far so good but we don't know yet. So we know how long the vaccine protects for as long as we have data from the trials and for as long as we know how much the virus exists in its current forms.Concerning side effects we know the potential side effects caused by the vaccine for up to 2 months after vaccination. The reactogenicity data from the trials were unalarming with nothing extraordinary present in the data. Sore arms fevers chills and the like are all common with other vaccines too so that's why no alarms were raised. Additionally more serious potential side effects like GS syndrome or narcolepsy...those tend to appear within 6 weeks of vaccination and the trial did not report anything of the sort 8 weeks after vaccination. If people want to know anything longer than that then they either need to continue to follow-up the vaccine participants or just leave the MHRA to run their Yellow Card system as usual and for the US to run its VAERS system too. But the safety record of the vaccine for 8 weeks is not in doubt and is indeed very encouraging.,TheFlyingMunkey,2020-12-11 14:23:37+00:00,,0.4883838383838384,0.0916666666666667,Positive,gf5n1ka,k81tsn

I had covid last year that was terrible so I was very hopeful for getting the vaccine especially being a teacher with 30 kids in my class daily. I’m 26 healthy if that helps only pre existing condition is I have anxiety issues. After getting the shot I had a bit of anxiety but it calmed down. Next day I woke up feeling like I’d been thrown from a car with my muscles all over aching my ankles knees back legs arms everything. The worst pain was the headache. It was a stabbing pain on the sides of my forehead and behind my eyes. I also had a fever of 102 and confined to my bed for nearly 3 days. 3 days later I woke up with no fever no more muscle soreness but the headache remained. Now it’s March 29th and every single day I’m still struggling with the same headache. Most days I wake up with it.

If you are unlucky and catch covid after it will be more mild and the viral load will be a lot smaller so it won't spread much if at all.[This study was done on Healthcare workers during the worst of the Virus in the USA so they were constantly exposed.The UK and Israel have similar studies.This information is for Pfizer and Moderna.

Even if children have not accounted for a significant portion of hospitalizations even contracting asymptomatic COVID could be detrimental as the children act as hosts for the development of COVID variants.The points you raise are indicative of why more time can be taken to authorize vaccines for children.

gfvtw4e,Well all they say is to be safe it‘s better to wait two months after getting the vaccine before getting pregnant. That‘s not that long a time. And importantly you‘ll be protected from covid during your pregnancy (where you‘ll be visiting more doctors so that’s a risk of exposure to covid!) and the stress of viral diseases during pregnancy can be really bad for the fetus (some like chickenpox herpes or strep B can have pretty bad effects and there is concerns that covid might). The vaccine is from all we know right now significantly safer than getting Covid :) &amp; x200B;I personally find their warning comforting because they clearly want people to be careful with stuff like pregnancy. because they haven‘t yet been fully able to test the effects of the vaccine if given during pregnancy they ask you not to take the risk. to me that shows more that they want you to be safe with the vaccination and protect your future baby.,TheShipIsAfoot,2020-12-15 03:13:00+00:00,,0.6093358395989975,0.2010025062656641,Positive,gf5hmne,k81tsn

Based on what I'd read on Reddit I was nervous so I took the next day off to recover after both my vaccines. They went super smoothly. The first one my arm was sore for a few days (which happens to me after every vaccine). I got kind of tired the day of but to be fair I'm always tired so who knows if it was even a vaccine side effect. After the second one my arm was sore for less time even took a nap and felt back to 100% the next morning. Drink plenty of water and relax.

You're probably just trolling but on the off chance you're participating in good faith:No vaccine is 100% effective and some folks have actual legitimate medical reasons to not receive them.  Therefore it has to be a social responsibility thing.  Once a certain mathematical immunity threshold is reached the virus can't effectively spread through a population and largely dies off being confined only to small manageable pockets of infection instead.

gwx6czx,&gt; The key folks in the equation are those who have NEVER been exposed and are also not vaxxed - but that proportion of folks shrinks every day since every infection pulls from this pool and adds to the immune pool.I’m not the person you were responding but it seems to me they aren’t saying it’s going to spread indefinitely amongst the unvaccinated as in reinfection but rather they were talking about the group you mentioned - those who are unvaccinated and have never been exposed. I think you’re underestimating without any concrete proof that number. How many people have never been vaxxed aren’t planning on getting vaxxed and also haven’t been exposed at all? Or even the ones who are unable to get it like children for example? It can spread amongst them and mutate enough to evade immunity. Currently children make up 22% of Covid cases so it’s already spreading amongst them. The number is something like ~71000 out of ~314000. There are ~74000000 kids in the US. That’s a large group to spread through and mutate. Hypothetically if that were to happen how long before a new strain which has the ability to evade immunity goes undetected? Especially when people think they’re protected because they were vaxxed or already had covid so have natural immunity and chalk it up to something else other than covid allowing it to spread further including amongst those with immunity (since it’s a new strain that evades the current immunity).,butterjellytoast,2021-05-04 16:04:04+00:00,,0.5075108225108225,0.0374675324675324,Positive,gwsv8c4,n3hw1f

On the retail partner side of CDC site it says 21 days can go up to 4 days late with 2nd dose.  Somewhere it says if you miss the second dose you have up to 42 days to make it up but the study results are not guaranteed.  I saw nothing about Walgreens getting a pass for 28 days.  But that’s what they claim.  I’d want to see it in writing.  I called Pfizer &amp; they said 21 days—the were firm.  I ended up scheduling somewhere else who also said 21 days.  If there is something from the CDC giving Walgreens permission for this I’d like them to produce it for everyone to see.

The only vax I ever ever had that actually hurt was tetanus.,Busy_Flatworm_149,2021-03-14 18:14:44+00:00,,0.4047619047619047,0.0309523809523809,Positive,m4mseb,m4mseb

lkk23y,24 Hours after my First Dose - Moderna Hello all! I’m a 23 yo healthy female. I got the vaccine because I work in education. My healthcare provider offers both Pfizer and Moderna but they don’t allow patients to choose which. I was given Moderna. Upon arrival I was given a packet of information that said several times “There is NO FDA approved vaccine for COVID-19.” Assuming that’s just legal semantics since the vaccine was only approved for emergency use. It was still a little unnerving to read as I sat in the chair being prepped. I didn’t even feel the needle. Super short duration very painless. Not even a pinch. They asked me to stick around for 15 minutes after to ensure there was no allergic reaction and there wasn’t. I was super anxious though just thinking about the possibility that there could be — so like someone else in this r I had an anxious response including some cold sweats and rapid heart rate. Normal for me as a person with anxiety disorders. Once I left I started to feel a little under the weather but I have had a little cold the past couple days anyway (neg COVID test). I think my immune system is just working hard. My arm started to feel tender around 6pm 4 hours after the vaccine. I woke up this morning feeling slightly feverish but the main side effect is the extreme tenderness of my arm. I woke up several times throughout the night because I had accidentally rolled onto it or something. It’s sensitive to the touch and liftingmovingtwisting it in any direction is uncomfortable. I haven’t taken any pain meds yet but will be taking ibuprofen after lunch. Not too bad honestly!,justjane7,2021-02-15 18:44:52+00:00,6.0,0.5425,-0.0361111111111111,Negative,1,lkk23y

Vertigo and nausea a week after vaccination (Moderna) 33 year old male - No significant PMHFirst shot 1228 - no APAP or Ibuprofen - feverchillsnauseasweating that nightFelt ok the day after except for the sore arm then day 3 had a terrible headache. Days 4-6 were completely normal but on the night of day 7 I had vertigo and was shaking and nauseous all night long the spinning didn’t last long (5 min) so I don’t even know if it would be diagnosed as vertigo. The nausea persisted through day 8 but overall felt much better. Over the next 6 days (brings us to today) I only feel “strange” at night and it’s gone in the morning sometimes I get dizzy like motion sickness when I’m just watching TV. My pulse jumps up 15-20 bpm I get flush and body temp raises a 1-2 degrees F. I’m not changing positions when this happens.Has anyone heard about this condition or any ideas what it could be? My PCP had me get a rapid and PCR COVID test which both came back negative. It’s beginning to feel psychosomatic and I’m doing it to myself.

I’m usually the one to get ALL the side effects of everything so I was sure that I would get them all with this. Also I’ve never had covid. Shot 1: got it in the morning and had a sore arm within an hour. I had no other symptoms that day and slept fine but my arm was hot to the touch and hurt to life the 2nd day. By day 4 I had no more arm pain. Day 2 I had very minor muscle aches but it didn’t slow me down from any of my normal activities. Shot 2: got it in the morning and within an hour my arm hurt. Within 2-3 hours I started to experience more intense body aches but took some Tylenol and a heating pad helped SO much. I was also super tired and overall just wanted to relax. I slept fine that night and the next day just felt overall crappy arm hurt but not as bad as the first shot. Body aches exhausted temp was 99.5 (but I run super hot so that’s actually not unusual for me). That being said still felt okay enough to do normal house stuff.

gfe3gk7,This is for the UK.I have not yet read something similar for the US but I do expect there will be some kinda of protections.I think at the end if the day it is not a matter of telling you to screw off. Pfizer probably did its best to come up with a solution to this health disaster in the amount of time it had. Folks are free to take the vaccine or not.  You can wait a year or two to see what happens with those who take the vaccine. Or you can trust the scientists did their best to ensure there are no side effects.It’s a complicated circumstance and I hear your concerns. I too have gone back and forth in what to do. But I think in the end you just gotta assume the risk you see best for yourself. Either take the vaccine and hope it’s as safe as Pfizer and the FDA say it is or do not take it and keep practicing measures to help prevent that you get COVID-19 knowing there is a risk you could get it.Best of luck!,abarrien00,2020-12-11 13:53:58+00:00,,0.4499999999999999,0.440625,Positive,kb105h,kb105h

ghtrcjp,Good point that I may not test negative so fast.  I am probably being too optimistic. My employer is requiring a negative test before employees can return in person.  I can work remotely if I feel up to it which I plan to take day by day.I did put a call into the CDC on 11 and the person whom answered the phone said she did not know how much time you have to wait after having COVID before you can get the second dose. She said that she would have someone else call me back.  So hopefully I will get a call back.  I also plan to call my hospital where I work on Monday and ask.  I am going to try and get a doctor at the hospital whom knows about COVID on the phone.  They knew that I had a pending test but not that I am positive yet since I found out the evening of 131 and I work M-F and had off for the New Year holiday.I am hesitant though to get it right away though based on your experiences. I will consider whatever more information I am able to obtain.My hospital has a policy that if you travel you have to have a Covid test within 24 hours of returning which I did on 1226 and it came back negative.  But now that I learned that it takes three to five days to test positive after exposure my hospital’s judgment and decision making regarding COVID is now in question.

menbj2,Moderna 1st Shot Sick As A Dog! I had a very bad case of Covid-19 in May 2020...really bad I had ALL the symptoms my doctor wanted to hospitalize me but I refused thinking they would vent me and I never come off the vent successfully...needless to say I almost died. Grateful I made it. I had “long haul” covid too even after I felt must better I still had memory loss and brain fogginess for months and fatigue would just hit me out the blue. Fast Forward: On Thursday March 25th I got the 1st Shot of the Moderna Vaccine at 1pm...by 6pm my arm was sore no big deal. By 10pm I had a massive headache so I went to bed. The next morning I got up for work at 6:30am and felt like I had been hit by a truck!!! My head hurt I was achy all over I was tired although I had just woke up! As the day went on it got worse my joints started to ache too I had to lay down because I had no energy and my back had a slight ache to it. I by 6pm I had a fever. I had been in. Ed all day so I made myself eat and took some ibuprofen laid back down. I woke up in a cold sweat guess my fever had broken...Today is Saturday the 27th and I feel better but still have a headache and feel tired but much better than yesterday. I am convinced that if you had Covid before the vaccine shots will be tough on you!!! I hope my 2nd shot is not this bad!!!!

ltx053,My experience with both Pfizer Vaccines! Got the first dose of Pfizer at 4:30 PM on a Friday. Felt absolutely no pain at injection (actually didn’t even seem like I got it — and I’m a HUGE WIMP for vaccinesblood drawing)Very sore arm actually a couple hours later and throughout the next two days. Absolutely no other side effects. Exercised per usual. Nothing.Got the second dose of Pfizer three weeks later an hour early. Felt much more of a pinching feeling at injection. Didn’t have any pain in the arm until later that night but honestly SUPER mild (I could lift it easily above my head which I couldn’t do after the first dose).That night however . . . Had intense rigor (chills then intense sweating) beating headache crazy fatigue and woke up feeling like a train had hit me. Hardly slept.I woke up popped two Extra Strength Tylenol took a hot shower and ate a full breakfast WITH coffee. I’m not kidding . . . 30 minutes later I was and AM CURRENTLY golden. I feel 110% better. Absolutely no side effects. Feel like I could run a marathon and if you’d told me that a couple hours ago I thought I was going to be bedridden for days.Insane. Just wanted to share my thoughts. And for those of you contemplating Tylenol do it! Just not before the vaccine.

However they’ve never been able to get FDA approval so now they’re trying to introduce this technology under the umbrella of vaccines. There is an anti-Covid vaccine bias in the interview so take it with a grain of salt if you listen.

But in particular as between Pfizer and Moderna both of which are mRNA vaccines the difference is particularly small.  Ask yourself if the risk from COVID is great enough to motivate you to get vaccinated then why accept the risk of waiting a week and have the vaccine not be available?,COVID_VacciNATION,2021-03-03 17:21:50+00:00,,0.5222222222222223,0.3194444444444444,Positive,lwu1df,lwu1df

Once I took it I was laughing and talking a family member but then 5 minutes in heart just started racing randomly.  It definitely could’ve been my mind just subconsciously being fearful.

I took off my mask off and got some fresh air outside  but then had all common panic attack symptoms sitting outside.   It took a hour to get my body calm down.

gege30d,For someone making off-handed remarks about the wisdom of others while at the same time being paranoid of the government to quote Ultron from Avengers Age of Ultron: You're unbearably naive.Turning location off does not turn off the phone's GPS completely you are still trackable. This is according to the National Security Agency.Second: There are plenty of ways for a government agency to turn stuff like that on. The Genovese crime family was wire tapped by the FBI using a specific method involving cell phones. This method allowed them to turn the microphone on the cell phone and listen in on anything going on in the immediate vicinity without the phone even appearing to be doing anything at all. And THAT technological approach has been around since 2006.All it takes is the government putting *some type* of a request to your cell phone provider and they can pretty much do a plethora of things. That includes making your phone trackable while making your tracking status appear to you as being off.And this is to say *nothing* of the back door exploits that government agencies including agencies within the United States use on a regular basis when it comes to not just our cell phones but many of our electronic devices and our telecommunications networks.,Grahfzer0,2020-12-03 04:23:38+00:00,,0.3033653846153846,0.13125,Positive,gef3e7d,k59kvt

glpmc44,If you plan on having kids in the future DO NOT take the vaccine. Many pregnant women have had miscarriages caused by receiving the Covid vaccine. There is evidence that may suggest that the vaccine attacks reproductive organs. Along with that there’s plenty of other serious side effects. Some people have serious allergic reactions and have gotten Stevens-Johnson syndrome (look up images of it). Others have gone deaf or blind. Of course most people do not have serious side effects but everyone taking it right now is a guinea pig. We do not know the long term ramifications of this vaccine. It hasn’t been proven safe NOR effective. Not sure why so many people are eager to take it. If you are a young and healthy individual Covid poses virtually no risk to you. Why risk going blind or getting Bell’s palsy from a vaccine that you DONT need. I’m not making any of this up.

I’ve looked at multiple resources online about whether it’s ok or not to take them and some sources are saying it’s ok others are saying to refrain from them so that the immune system isn’t suppressed against the vaccine. So 16 hours after the vaccine I finally cracked and took ibuprofen because my arm was very sore and I couldn’t fall asleep. So Should I be concerned about the vaccine being less effective now that I took those ibuprofen?

gsz8c3i,keep in mind most appendixes that are taken out have nothing wrong with them. if they had stomach issues or pain the doctors may have misdiagnosed them. Let me tell you a true story...I had severe pain in my abdomen that mimicked appendicitis went to ER they took some diagnostics and immediately started prepping a surgery to  remove my appendix. As I was discussing with the surgeon the surgery they were about to perform a hospital aid or nurse I do not remember rushed in and said my labs were back and I had some other  kind of bacterial infection in my intestines. Surgery was called off. Course of antibiotics and and a week later I was fine. I eventually had a scope to look inside my lower intestines and it showed scaring from the infection I had. Appendicitis is dangerous a lot of times they move quickly with out confirmation to insure it doesn't burst and really cause issues (death). The majority of times the removed appendix shows no signs of issue.[,Neogeo71,2021-04-01 00:49:40+00:00,,0.4931818181818181,0.1068181818181818,Positive,mgkeui,mgkeui

Woke up around 1AM shivering the energy it took walking to use the restroom felt way more monumental than it should have.  Skip forward to around 3AM and not only have I been unable to sleep for more than 15 minutes at a time but now I'm BURNING HOT and sweating like a sow.  Dragged myself out of bed around 9AM and have parked on the couch for the day.  Ibuprofen helped with the headache joint pain and muscle pain but it wore off and I'm not keen on taking more at the moment.Pretty sure I had a short fever that broke overnight I couldn't find our thermometer hobbling around at 1AM and didn't have the energy to keep digging for it.Still feel extremely run down and achey.Cliff notes version sore arm (though not as bad as the first dose) fever (likely) headache fatigue chills joint pain muscle pain somewhat dry eyes and that crappy feeling my skin gets when I'm sick.,DuManchu,2021-02-24 20:43:34+00:00,,0.5754724111866969,0.0343726379440665,Positive,lrfm53,lrfm53

mi7oro,2nd dose soon after having Covid? Hey guys I’m looking for advice on taking my second dose of the vaccine next week. A few weeks ago I was exposed to Covid (unknowingly) and the day after I received my first dose. This was on a Thursday and on Sunday my Covid symptoms began. I am over the hump so to speak and only have minor lingering symptoms like fatigue and a bit of a cough. Other than that I’m okay. I asked my doctor about whether I should wait to receive the second dose (Pfizer 4 week separation - i know it’s supposed to be 3 weeks but i blame Walgreens scheduling) and he was basically like “I have no idea this is new territory for me”. My inclination now that I’m feeling better is to go ahead and get the second dose as scheduled and pray my immune system is revved up and ready to go. That being said I’m worried it’s a little too soon as I didn’t have the easiest go with Covid. It definitely took a toll on my body so I don’t want to stress my body out more than I need to. Thoughts? Has anyone seen any research on this? Recommendations? Thanks!,bearorr1992,2021-04-01 23:20:06+00:00,0.0,0.3146043771043771,0.0985479797979797,Positive,1,mi7oro

ln59w8,First dose Pfizer shot Hey there! I'm a 25F with chronic illness (Dystonia Stiff Person Syndrome Rheumatoid Arthritis Dysautonomia) and just got my first shot today at 11:50 this morning. I was pretty anxious to get it and had a cup of coffee right before which I think contributed a lot to what I'm about to describe. About two minutes after I received my shot my heart rate shot up. I tried counting the beats and it was around 125-130. Started to feel a little dizzy and tingly in my arms but not to a point where I felt something was seriously wrong. I flagged down a nurse let her know and they checked on me about every five minutes. After about 20 minutes it got significantly better and I stayed for about 40 minutes instead of the typical 15 before walking out to my car in the parking lot. Chilled there for another 20 minutes just so I could get to a full hour and felt a lot better.I had another doctor's appointment actually with my cardiologist. They took my vitals and it was still resting at about 100 so I mentioned to him how my reaction to the vaccine went and he wasn't too concerned. Personally I trust him 100% so when he said he wasn't worried it eased my worries and I started to really consider my anxiety being a large factor. Around when I left this appointment at 1:30 I was having chills and also feeling hot. Got home and immediately drank about 16 ounces of water. Continued to feel better though still a little weird.Around 2:30 I took my temp and it was 99.9 though I decided to just ride it out for an hour before taking ibuprofen. Forgot to check but took it at 7:00 and it was 98.3 (woohoo!). I think my main issue is that I don't actually know how to separate my chronic illness symptoms from the side effects of the vaccine since a lot of them are similar. Slight nausea muscle aches headache joint pain and fatigue are daily symptoms for me regularly and I have them today as well. I guess I'll just try to see if anything feels worse than normal over the next few days. Overall everything is moderate and tolerable. Hope you all are well safe and healthy! I'm counting down the days to get my second dose. Even though this whole process has been a little weird and unexpected it's still given me a good peace of mind.

I also had a headache chills body aches fatigue and spiked a 103 fever last night. It broke this morning but it was a rough night needless to say. Still feeling quite tired and just not fully recovered yet. I was a bit worried at first with my reaction but it sounds like it’s somewhat common from what I’ve read on it.

lu6h3j,Chest pain (like heartburn?) sustained after covid vaccine Hi! I got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine 3 weeks ago. I got my second one yesterday. About a week after my first dose I got like a weird intense chest pain that lasted maybe 5-10 minutes. It kinda felt like what I would imagine heartburn feels like (I have never had heartburn)... but it was like almost in my lower esophagus or very upper chest. Since then it has happened on at least 5 other days. One day it lasted literally 12 hours straight. Tums didn’t touch the pain and it had nothing to do with eating so I don’t think it’s heartburn. Breathing deep made it worse. Has anybody else had this happen?,kstbrenard,2021-02-28 04:44:59+00:00,11.0,0.440151515151515,-0.0386363636363636,Negative,1,lu6h3j
gwww7ep,This. Similar to how people will leave reviews after a bad experience more than they tend to leave one after a good or neutral experience. Likely because when everything goes swimmingly it tends to leave your mind  because that’s how it was supposed to go - nothing out of the ordinary and all that. When things go bad or not as expected we feel gypped and make a complaint either with the hope that we’ll be made whole or at least validated; or just simply to warn others. When we commiserate together we don’t feel so alone. Likewise it gives us some perspective. Some people may have anxiety and know they have a tendency to overthink overreact or just get stuck in their own head so hearing someone else say “I hear you and I understand” or “this was also my experience” helps us realize we’re not crazy or alone; and sometimes we come out on the other side with some useful coping advice. I also think it helps people who are or may be hesitant to get the vaccine so they know what they’re getting into ahead of time. The clinical view is cut-and-dry regarding side side effects but it lacks that human factor and doesn’t necessarily tell you the severity. There’s also not really any universal guidelines on how to deal withtreat the symptoms if at all - or if a certain treatment you’d normally use is safe in this instance. Instead they just tell you to report any side effects and that’s it. It can seem like you’re just another number which just further validates those who already think this is some “experiment”. Sure you can ask your doctor but majority of people aren’t getting vaccinated by their doctor or anyone they’re familiar with. There needs to be a human factor in my opinion. I don’t mean everyone should be coddled - I just mean they need to relay information like they’re talking to other humans rather than their fellow lab coats. There’s currently a clash of personalities between average people and scientistsdoctors and the trend is only growing. People want to feel like they at least matter. If they’re not getting that they’re going to wonder why they should bother to help out; or why they should care about the greater good if those overseeing the greater good don’t seem to care.The cut-and-dryclinical outlook also doesn’t account for side effects that end up being rather common but weren’t shared initially whether it was from lack of discovery due to inability to find a causal link overlooked them due to other factors or weren’t prevalent enough to be noteworthy or significant. So sharing negative experiences here allows those who are or may be hesitant to access more information - information that they’re not getting elsewhere - in order to be well-informed and decide what’s right for them. I think a lot of the reason people tend to distrust the science and those in the field is because they feel like they’re not being told the full truth or they feel like information is being directly withheld from them. Why would something need to be hidden if it was safe? (This is not my view; just my observation based on conversations I’ve had with some who are skeptical.) Theres a big disconnect going on and until that gap is bridged I’m afraid the gap is only going to widen. Humans need connection and compassion. If you want people to listen that’s the recipe. Talking to them in a robotic and seemingly unsympathetic manner isn’t going to do anyone any good.,butterjellytoast,2021-05-04 14:55:11+00:00,,0.5007731253420908,0.0591954022988505,Positive,gwv38n5,n4a9zi

But after 48 hours all those symptoms were gone. A coworker of mine had zero side effects with the first dose and developed a pretty strong fever for 12 hours after his second dose. Another coworker had zero side effects the first dose and developed a slight fever headache and muscle soreness. But after 48 hours everyone's symptoms have seems to gone away.

lx5nak,First dose of the Pfizer yesterday + a reaction I got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday afternoon. I’m quite grateful!However within about an hour of getting it I developed the deepest ache in both of my arms. It ran from the outside of my shoulders all the way down to my wrists. I obviously only received the injection in one but it felt like both. The pain was very achey and uncomfortable by the peak of it I could barely lift my arms. I also had a bit of a headache and nausea but that could have been anxiety from the pain.About 8 hours afterwards it stopped completely. I felt fine again &amp; now I am only mildly sore at the injection site 24 hours later.I just want to add to the collection of experiences &amp; hope to comfort anyone who may have the same reaction with the fact that it did indeed pass! I took Naproxen Sodium made sure to eat something laid on my back with my arms at my side and found that sound progressive muscle relaxation seemed to help at peak pain levels. It could have been unrelated as well as I have some physical health problems that cause chronic pain but my gut and the timing lead me to believe pretty confidently that it was a reaction.For this I am definitely a bit more nervous about the next one!

gql9cn1,You’re good! LmaoSo I’ll answer that question in terms of American laws regulations etc. just because that’s what I know if you or anyone else is in a different country I can’t speak on their process because I have no idea what it is. I wouldn’t think that the age of the company has any affect on the safety or trust in their products. The reason for that is because all biological products that are to be tested in the United States must go through the very long very difficult process of trial phases. This goes for medical devices vaccinations drugs etc before they are approved for use to the American public. Before I go on I’m going to use real life examples based on my time working in clinical research during my gap year. Both vaccines from moderna and Pfizer went through the exact same phases and trials showing safety and efficacy prior to being FDA approved. Generally for a drug or vaccine to be safe for use they go through all trial phases and then marketed. But since we are in a pandemic they expedited the phases and administration processes. Now all phases were completed for the vaccines but the difference this time was that they planned the next phase before the prior phase was completed. Nonetheless they went through every phase and still worked and showed safety. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization to help speed the process up and they only did this because it proved to work and be safe. The companies began manufacturing the vaccines before the EUA was given so that once the EUA was in effect they could distribute quickly instead of waiting to manufacture and then finally distributing. Both Pfizer and moderna vaccines went through this FDA process so no matter when those companies formed they still have the same restrictions and must follow the same protocol as all the other companies regardless of when they company was founded. I worked on a case in clinical research on a drug that was only used as EUA for individuals with nontuberculosis mycobacterium before I quit they were still in the process of getting it approved for this specific patient. EUAs do happen we just never hear about them because they are usually done on a smaller scale and for rare instances.The way I look at it startups recruit scientists from everywhere- fresh out of grad school tenure track professor running a lab at a university and other industries (like Pfizer) to build a repertoire and create a knowledgeable workforce who can bring new ideas to the table. It’s possible some of the moderna scientists were former scientists with Pfizer Johnson and Johnson Merck bayer etc who took a chance with a new startup! But I can see your point a startup vs an established company. No matter what they both had to go through the same processes to get an approved vaccine. I don’t think the amount will make a difference in the short or long term it produces the same effects! I don’t think they took a look at the amount of mRNA in doses vs immune response but I can’t imagine it being a factor. If anything I’m sure the amount being given affects manufacturing which would be the companies issue and they might have to tone it down if they can’t keep up with production. But as far as biological effects goes I don’t see how one would be greater or worse over the other in the short term or long term. It might just be taken up by more dendritic cells to present to your T cells than Pfizer or in the kinetics sense be broken down after a certain amount and degraded and never seen again!,THelperCell,2021-03-11 16:53:49+00:00,,0.4060559375265258,0.0574881871940695,Positive,gql39kc,m2hfh5

gswee1e,Call me conspiratorial fine - but based on my experience with this as well as many others that I see online it makes me wonder how there’s no trial data on this. Israel cautioned about this side effect and now the US is experiencing it too. For some it goes away in hours  days for others weeks to months.I believe the FDA knows about it as well. A hospital here in the US I think in PA (don’t quote me on this) suspended their vaccination program after four folks showed tingling symptoms.This is a neurological side effect and it’s something I hadn’t experienced with any other vaccine. Is it mild GBS? MS? I haven’t heard any conclusive answers yet. A lot of people experiencing this for weeks and they’re extremely worried. Check in’s with the ER normal blood work doctors largely don’t know what to do. I hope we get answers but we’re in uncharted territory here so the jury is still out on why this vaccine is causing this.,chavotunes,2021-03-31 10:00:34+00:00,,0.6066964285714286,0.2705357142857142,Positive,mgydau,mgydau

gr78qga,I disagree. anaphylaxis is already established. Monitoring for adverse events is ongoing. In the FDA’s report for the emergency authorization they noted that in particular there may be causation with Bell’s palsy‘s and this is being looked at closely. I think “safe” implies totally safe for everybody nothing bad will happen and that’s obviously not true.  It appears at this time that the vaccines are safer than COVID. Getting Covid is very unsafe. In my opinion that’s the point. If you’re just telling someone that the vaccine is safe but not telling them about the possible adverse events you are misrepresenting the vaccine.,Armison,2021-03-17 03:31:57+00:00,,0.5562499999999999,0.1239583333333333,Positive,gr75kw0,m6blm2

This is NOT true.Source: As for the 5 or so biotech companies who are using some fetal matter here’s what a bioethicist has to say about it:*”But Arthur Caplan a bioethicist at the New York University School of Medicine counters: “There are better ways to win the abortion wars than telling people not to use a vaccine. These are long-over abortions. These cells are decades old and even major religious leaders like the pope have acknowledged that for the greater good it’s not worth the symbolism to put the community at risk.”*Source: There’s been a lot of anti-science buzz about the COVID pandemic and the vaccines being developed.

mfhlov,Vision Side Effects Has anyone had any vision issues after getting their first and second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine? My father just had his second shot and within 30 minutes lost most of the vision in his right eye. He immediately got into our family ophthalmologist who sent him to a retinal specialist an hour later. The retinal specialist said that there was so much blood and swelling in his eye that it was hard to see anything but the ultrasound showed a compromise in the retina. He is having surgery to try to repair it tomorrow. Of course this could have been a coincidence but it just so happens my father had his yearly vision exam a week before his first vaccine shot and pictures were taken of his retina showing no damage or concern. He was complaining about blurry vision after the first shot but blamed it on his contact lenses. I had him download V-safe and input his symptoms but I haven’t found much similar to what he is experiencing. Here is the timeline of his symptoms:1st dose: blurry vision in the right eye that continued but decreased in intensity. It never crossed his mind that it could be the vaccine. No one at our township vaccination center told him about v-safe so he never reported anything. 2nd dose: waited the 10 minutes for allergic reaction. No one dismisses you you just wait and then leave if you’re fine. He left and by the time he got to his car in the parking lot he had “20 or so floaters”. 10 minutes later as he was driving home (he had to drive 45 minutes away into the city) his vision was very blurry and he felt like he was “looking through a foggy window with floaters”. 30 minutes after injection (still 25-30 min drive home) he could only see light through the fog and that’s how it stayed. He drove straight to the ophthalmologist office who was nice enough to try to help. I haven’t even seen vision issues as a side effect. Any info on possible vision issues after the vaccine would help in deciding how to move forward in his care. I know his retinal specialist was also looking into it but thought I would mention the possible connection here. His COVID test (taken yesterday) for pre-op prep was negative.,RahRah617,2021-03-29 04:24:09+00:00,18.0,0.4190035273368607,0.1017195767195767,Positive,1,mfhlov

You are being a lamb to the slaughter taking an improperly tested gene 'therapy' where you are the guinea pig.2.

This should have never been a pandemic because there are tried and tested safe treatments available some of which have been suppressed because they do work: Hydroxychloroquine Chloroquine Ivermectin Quercetin Zinc Vitamin C Vitamin D. You're even using the term 'anti-vaxxer' which was given to you by psychopathic oligarchs who support corrupt vaccine companies to employ their depopulation campaigns. Be honest have you ever done research into Pfizers background of paying millions out in reparations for destroying the lives of countless families or are you just blindly following the robotic 'it's safe' mantra that is repeated on television billboards posters magazines etc by companies who themselves have no clue about what the 'vaccine' does short or long term?

glbbtin,I guess we “lucked out” in my family. My teen was called due to being immunosuppressed because of asthma. In the case that there was a mistake because of my teen being 15 12 not 16 I took my 71 year old mom. When we got there they asked how many in the car were getting it. I said just my kid although my mom is over 70 and diabetic. They asked her if she wanted it. We said yes absolutely. Then they asked about me. I said I’m 47 but I work in healthcare with seniors and haven’t received it yet. So they had both of us register. All three of us got the shot and are scheduled for  2 mid February. I thought about the ethics of it but honestly my kid is immunosuppressed and is actually in the school building my mom is high risk and my job and my own autoimmune disease puts me at higher risk. So we’ve all “lucked out” thus far by being safe and missing family get togethers having groceries delivered working from home giving up hobbies. None of us got covid.

gqsh9lx,Your partner has been vaccinated. That is sufficient. Here's an NIH study showing that it's the accumulation of comorbidities not the years that lead to increased mortality with age. In fact once the comorbidities are fully accounted for age is no longer significant. This is actually a huge problem as politicians have monopolized the COVID vaccines and in most states assigned all of the doses to people 65+ while simultaneously preventing people with comorbidities from obtaining them at all.   In my state people 18-64 with 2 or more comorbidities aren't scheduled to begin getting vaccinated until April 26th just four days before Biden's new May 1st opening for all adults. To those that have comorbidities that pronouncement was the sound of the line collapsing around them. It's taken three months to service just 13% of the population. A lot of those people worked at health care facilities.   Starting March 17th they're planning on vaccinating people (regardless of health) pregnant women disabled people and people that work in congregate settings (jails food processors grocery stores fishing boats etc.).  A month later they're planning on vaccinating people 50 and over with have two or more comorbidities. Two weeks later anyone 18 and over with two or more comorbidites.   Then just four days later anyone and apparently they're working hard to enable people to signup even earlier than that.

gg6apht,I won't claim to know all the answers but I think I can help with some of your questions. Here's what I know from my perspective:1.) Is it 100% effective? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 95% and 94% effective according to the study trials which is really good. That's like 80x more effective than the flu vaccine. For now though we're going to continue to wear masks because all of this stuff is still brand new so we want to err on the safe side. There's also still a question about whether vaccinated people can still pass on the virus as asymptomatic carriers but early info from the Moderna study suggests that it stops transmissions.2.) Can mRNA change our DNA? No I don't think that's a concern with mRNA because of how it's designed. While DNA gets used to to make new RNA all the time it's not normal for our cells to go the other direction to take random new RNA to modify our DNA template. The few common exceptions I can think of are viruses like HIV which specifically use uniquely made enzymes (reverse transcriptase enzyme) specifically to attack our DNA. But in the context of mRNA vaccines there's no special enzyme to make it go that direction. The mRNA just wants to make proteins and it usually doesn't want to go the other direction unless there's something to make it go that direction. My understanding is flu viruses and COVID-19 viruses already shove their RNA into our cells and I don't think they change our DNA because they don't have or make retrovirus enzymes to force it to go that direction. As a disclaimer I'm not a genomics expert so perhaps I'm missing a few details here.3.) Will we need more boosters? From what has been studied so far we only need two shots (taken 21 days apart) to produce strong and pretty durable antibody response. I don't know that there's enough information to answer whether or not we will need another boost next winter and I don't think anyone knows for sure yet. But the impression that we got is that the two shots we're getting should cover us for the current outbreak. I'm cautious about what our antibody levels look like in 6 months and I'm hoping that they elaborate on the duration of coverage in the future.,Garfield3d,2020-12-17 20:02:38+00:00,,0.5267359744632472,0.1428440246622064,Positive,gg5ic5k,keq6mr

gsqcq58,"I don't understand why people with prior covid especially recent covid are getting the vaccine?  The data on immunity from prior infection is so far that it is at least as good as vaccine-induced immunity (and is likely broader since you have had exposure to the whole viral protein rather than just spike.)  Think of it this way:  studies like the vaccine trials have been done (30K UK health care workers) comparing ""placebo"" ( i.e. no covid) to ""dose"" (i.e. covid) and ""covid"" is more effective than any of the vaccines. There may be some justification to getting a single dose 6 months later to ""boost"" the immunity especially if you had a mild or asymptomatic case.  But for more recent infections there is a legitimate safety concern and at least one immunologist it trying raise awareness:  if you had recent covid then there can be lingering antigen (viral fragments) in the cells that were infected.  When you stimulate the immune systems with the vaccine the immune response will target those cells and cause inflammation. This might just be uncomfortable but if it is for example epithelial cells lining the blood vessels you could have damage with consequences.  Also note that people with prior covid were excluded from the Phase 3 trials for obvious reasons (don't want them in the placebo arm) and while a few got through screening of course  we don't have real safety or adverse event data for people with prior covid.",ArizonaRocks,2021-03-29 21:17:16+00:00,,0.4255952380952381,0.0734126984126984,Positive,mffcl8,mffcl8

gwvhfgv,The Nuremberg Code (1947)Permissible Medical ExperimentsThe great weight of the evidence before us to effect that certain types of medical experiments on human beings when kept within reasonably well-defined bounds conform to the ethics of the medical profession generally. The protagonists of the practice of human experimentation justify their views on the basis that such experiments yield results for the good of society that are unprocurable by other methods or means of study. All agree however that certain basic principles must be observed in order to satisfy moral ethical and legal concepts:1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice without the intervention of any element of force fraud deceit duress overreaching or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature duration and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society unprocurable by other methods or means of study and not random and unnecessary in nature.3. The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results justify the performance of the experiment.4. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.5. No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except perhaps in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.6. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.7. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury disability or death.8. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.9. During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.10.During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage if he has probable cause to believe in the exercise of the good faith superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury disability or death to the experimental subject.,LucidBigFoot,2021-05-04 05:19:15+00:00,,0.4218650793650792,0.0776984126984127,Positive,n3hw1f,n3hw1f

I just woke up with some funky chills (no fever) but my arm hurts enough that I'm thinking about ripping it off completely... but after reading your comment I've never been so happy to be so uncomfortable,1saltedsnail,2021-02-17 06:57:53+00:00,,0.5107142857142858,0.1035714285714285,Positive,gndgoys,ljcler

lketxf,CVSWalgreens barriers to access appointments I live in Ohio and have lots of older relatives in the state who are trying to sign up for COVID vaccine appointments.Out of curiosity I went on two major pharmacy distributors’ websites (CVS and Walgreens). CVS appointments are all booked in metro Cleveland whereas Walgreens has a **huge** amount of open appointments. The difference? It may have to do with the fact that Walgreens requires setting up an online profile (with email address etc.) before you can even see whether the vaccine is available in your area. In fact you have to put in tons of information (age race etc.) before you can even see whether there are open spots in your area. For many folks 70+ this is a big lift.CVS on the other hand has an easily accessible map on their COVID page that allows you to click on the state and see if there are any open slots. When you sign up you need to provide a phone number (no email required).Again there are probably other issues at play leading to the discrepancy in number of available appointments but Walgreens’ gated access model of seeing appointment availability is probably not helping. Other providers (e.g. Cleveland Clinic) have a similar model (i.e. sign up for an account with us before seeing availability). At the very least Walgreens and other providers needs to be forced to put their appointment availabilities on a public part of their site that doesn’t require user email login and Walgreen account creation. It’s not a hard switch from a web development perspective and they are losing a lot more people than they think by making them jump through significant hoops to even see availability. There are probably a lot of older people who are demotivated by these providers’ frustrating interface (and requirement of email address) who are probably giving up leading to slower vaccine rollout.,roxfox3,2021-02-15 14:34:29+00:00,6.0,0.4538,0.0815212121212121,Positive,1,lketxf

The only time something like that has ever happened is when a radioactive spider bit Peter Parker. Short term side effects (defined as what exactly? Be precise this is science) were unremarkable in clinical trials. Long term side effects (again if you want to talk science then be more precise please) were also unremarkable.Compensation depends on the laws in your country.

How much of a immune response you have how sick you get how long you are contagious etc are all questions that need to be answered.  But in the mean time the fact that one dose gives 52% coverage and two doses gives 95% seems like it's probably all the math being done.  52% coverage for twice as many people as 95% percent coverage for half as many IS a slightly better outcome.If the remaining 42% who can still catch the virus after one dose have a much less severe case because of the partial immunity it's a MUCH better outcome than half as many people having virtually no reaction.,Reneeisme,2021-01-04 18:52:15+00:00,,0.4563095238095238,0.1182142857142857,Positive,kq8qhj,kq8qhj

gwdmbzg,In regards to post vaccination side effects: Honestly I wouldn’t recommend premedicating beforehand because whatever reaction you have whether it be a short headache or a fever is your body’s natural immune response. In regards to the symptoms you experienced shortly after your immunization: You can’t really prevent vasovagal response if that was what you were experiencing it’s just a nerve response people get sometimes.Just stay hydrated and afterward as long as you aren’t allergic and it isn’t contraindicated with your other medications I recommend Tylenol!,AmberDeeeeee,2021-04-30 02:27:44+00:00,,0.471875,0.18671875,Positive,gwdbkki,n1gvqn

gn2ovgj,"Thank   you for being the guinea pig to test a vaccine for us that has had  zero  studies about long-term effects zero studies about its effects on   fertility and pregnancies zero studies about if it even provides any   protection for longer than two months and that did bypass those usually   required studies with emergency admissions.To answer your question here are the immediate effects that you can expect:Pfizer: [Moderna: [In   the Pfizer document the immediate adverse events are in the table   starting at page 35. With ""Severe"" meaning that you aren't able to do   daily activities (aka go to work) when marked with (a) and requires at   least intravenous hydration when marked with (b).So   with the first dose you will have about a 2 to 3% chance of having   severe reaction and a 27% chance that you experience pain that requires   you to take pain medication. The second dose is much more brutal with 5   to 10% for sever reactions and 45% requiring pain medication.It   has a 10 to 20 times higher rate of adverse events than established   vaccinations that did go through the required studies like the Tetanus   or Hepatitis vaccine. And as mentioned long-term effects are totally   unknown and the people who get the vaccine now are the test subjects.If you compare the table of the different age groups you will see that older people have a much lower rate of adverse events than younger people. Even thought that the study doesn't want to explain this it is because older people have a weaker immune system therefore their body fights less against the vaccine. But don't be fooled into thinking that this means that the vaccine would be well accepted by the older people now even the lower rate of adverse events are a dozen times higher than for any other common vaccine.And for all age groups applies:No guarantee that the vaccine gives any protection for  longer than two months (page 46).",alphas12,2021-02-12 16:45:19+00:00,,0.43,-0.0386666666666666,Negative,liera2,liera2

They had this vaccine ready to go last January- they just had to go through the clinics trials etc...2. Fact: A 29 year old acquaintance who ran 100 mile marathons died from covid this summer.3. I’m a nurse. I’ve seen people die from this but now I’m seeing the long term effects in my patients - of all ages. I have a patient with newly developed atrial fibrillation and heart damage so bad from the covid she contracted in October that she is now on hospice. I am seeing a lot of neurological issues post-covid in all ages ranges. Anything from severe migraines to newly diagnosed depression and even psychosis. I have seen people become suicidal a couple months after they have “recovered.” I know precious healthy individuals (in their 20s and 30s) that had covid last spring and still can’t return to hobbies like running because they get short of breath with exertion.

Hence the unlikelihood that there will be any long term side effects. It just wasn’t good at long term anything. I have a close family member who spearheads actual gene therapy cancer research so I think I can say that’s not quite what this is. Gene therapy edits the original genetic information each cell carries i.e. to fix defective cancer cells. This is permanent and done in a variety of different ways but entirely differently than mRNA-based biotechnology.

gpl3iuz,I got a call on Saturday from my GP surgery asking me to attend today. I asked why I’m mid 30’s with no underlying health conditions and have been working from home since last March. I said I must have been added to the list by accident and if they wanted to check and call me back I wouldn’t be annoyed. Didn’t want to take a vaccine from someone who needed it- they said to attend the appointment if I didn’t hear back from them. I didn’t get a call back so I got the first dose this morning. No point it going to waste I guess. I do feel guilty though. I’m assuming there was some kind of systems error and I tried to get them to check I know people at my surgery who are medically vulnerable and haven’t been called yet. Very strange.

gszh8kt,Med student here Why would you want to suppress your immune system when you take a vaccine? The whole point is to elicit an inflammatory reaction to trigger the immune system so it works and creates defense against the real thing. Like live vaccines aren’t given to immunosuppressive people cause the vaccine could trigger the actual illness since they’re immune system is suppressed.Just my own opinion I think turmeric would definitely aid in calming the side effects of the vaccine by inhibiting the inflammatory substances but I don’t see how it would “aid” the vaccine in eliciting an immune response.,dO11u,2021-04-01 02:07:25+00:00,,0.4666666666666667,0.1893939393939393,Positive,mhg30g,mhg30g

mf8naj,Pfizer - 36yr Old Male Experience TL;DR - It’s been over a week since my second Pfizer dose and I only experienced generally mild symptoms.About Me:- Male - 36 years old - Healthy BMI and physically in shape First dose:- Arm pain - Armpit pain - Neck and shoulder stiffnesspain - Moderate headache   Overall the reaction from the first dose was tolerable. Worst part was the neck and shoulder stiffnesspain which I think caused the headache. This lasted 2 days or so.Second dose:- Arm pain - Armpit painOverall the symptoms from the second dose were milder than the first which seems quite uncommon. During this dose the most prominent reaction was the armpit pain which was fairly intense at times. Assuming this was a lymph node reaction. This again lasted around 2 days During this time I engaged in regular activity went on multiple runs and after the second dose had some wine on day 3.

Allergic reactions have been happening with the vaccine but that can happen with anything. When I received my dose they had Benadryl and an epi pen on standby. They will have those on hand at the hospital where you go. She is only upset because she is worried about you it’s coming from a place of love. I would reassure her that they will be able to take care of you in the rare case you do have an allergic reaction. Maybe she would feel better if she came with you and could see for herself that you are ok after you get it.,Luna920,2020-12-31 18:44:29+00:00,,0.690625,0.28125,Positive,kni32j,kni32j

gwbm7sp,I had extreme fatigue the day after the first dose. Like it felt as if I had been drugged or taken muscle relaxers or something. After the second dose—about 4 hours later my arm started to hurt. I went to bed another hour or two after that and woke up in the middle of the night with both arms hurting headache fever and chills. It was about 10 hours after I received the shot. It lasted all day along with some pretty wicked fatigue and was relieved somewhat by Advil every 5 hours. That lasted almost exactly 24 hours. I woke up at 3am the next day completely soaked in sweat but feeling much better. Second day after vaccine I was just a little bit worn out. Nothing like the fatigue from before.

goe431a,I could have written this very post. I had the same thoughts as you. And am in the same situation (no family nearby healthy and active although a little older than you). I had the opportunity to get the vaccine because of my work and at the last minute decided to (I've received 1st dose Pfizer 2nd dose will be in March). I can't give you any concrete reasons to or not to; it was literally a trust my instincts moment on my part to go through with it. If doing so helps be part of the solution right now I feel like that is a good reason. That said if this becomes a yearly thing I will never do it again. I don't do yearly flu shots either. Just my personal preference not anti-vax either. There are no guarantees there won't be long side effects down the road. That's something each person has to decide they are or aren't ok with.

lxkrjr,Mother dies a week after taking Covid19 vaccine My mother in law took the covid 19 vaccine one dose we're not sure which one at this time. The only symptoms she told us about at first was that her head was feeling a very sharp pain we just brushed it off as a regular side effect she was still able to go about her day and continue on with her regular activities. We spent Saturday with her celebrating her 60th birthday she seemed fine. Sunday things took a turn for the worst and Tuesday night 1am she passed away. So exactly one week after taking the vaccine she dies. We are all in shock and disbelief as it happened so fast! We are still waiting on an autopsy just to be sure. But what else can we think after a healthy active person takes one shot of the vaccine and just declines really badly and passed away. Tuesday night before the ambulance came she was constantly falling down loss of memory and diarrhea she couldn't control her bowel movement so she poo'ed on herself.

I started getting the scratchy throat but it seems to not be progressing further.

At around three I felt really really hot and my heart rate went up incredibly fast. I took a paracetamol and waited a few minutes. But my heart rate went through the roof. I guess about 170 bpm or 180 bpm? I called the ambulance and they got a heart rate of 160 bpm. They took me to the hospital where I currently am.

gwzln8h,My advice from an extremely anxious person who worked herself into a panic over the possible side effects of the 2nd shot (only sore arm for the first after anticipating much worse and possibly an early menstrual cycle) I will tell you exactly what I experienced after the 2nd shot: the shot itself hurt way less (I honestly believe some people are just much better at giving them).  I got it at 1pm on a Tuesday and felt fine the rest of the daynight. I woke up early on Wednesday (I never wake up early) with joint and muscle pain mainly in my lower body.  Like my hips and knees especially. I had a low-grade fever too. I slept from 1p-7p on Wednesday. I felt better when I woke up but then my temperature started creeping up again (got up to 101F) and the body aches returned.  I developed chills as well.  I took Advil and went to bed; my fever broke which was great but I sweated profusely whole night.  Woke up Thursday thought I felt better but then the aches and low-grade fever returned. I started feeling like wtf will I ever get better??  Thursday night into Friday I finally felt normal and had no lasting side effects. Bottom line: it's possible you might feel like shit for a day or two but nothing you can't handle and then it's over.  There is life on the other side. 😊,LoudSundae9443,2021-05-05 04:02:30+00:00,,0.5502688172043011,0.1416666666666667,Positive,n1ql6q,n1ql6q

If you still have to wear a mask social distance can't gather your friends and family and it doesn't protect you from others why get it? If you die from it like people have there is no compensation from the manufacturer or the government. Why get it? I think it's a bad idea. More people have died from the flu than from COVID and the flu shot was never forced on us.

Thats from the CDC's website.[&amp; x200B;The thing is to say based on how mRNA vaccines work we don't think its likely to cause a problem is a weird statement. You could make a mRNA vaccine that teaches the immune system to attack any protein in the body. So they could make one that would do that.What they mean to say is ""We don't think THIS mRNA vaccine works that way."" However the protein it teaches the immune system to attack is important for the fetus binding in the uterus. Its what makes the bond there and could for example increase ectopic pregnancies or all kinds of things. The warning from these ""trolls"" like myself who are taking our personal time while being formally attacked for going against what people want to hear is that  WE DONT KNOW FOR SURE AND IT IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE ITS NOT BEEN TESTED. The reason it is dangerous is because the same protein exists there that the immune system is taught to attack and it has NOT been studied.&amp; x200B;The risks of dying of covid as a young person are extremely low at &lt;0.005%.

gn44qho,I'm 26 and my aunt is 56. We both got the Pfizer vaccine. She had no complaints after the first dose. I was in pretty bad pain from the first dose. My arm pain lasted 4 days and got worse each day. In hindsight I really should have take a Tylenol or something but I just deal with the pain. When my aunt got the second dose she came home with arm pain and swelling. She had a high fever the next two days and she mentioned feeling very fatigued. She was fine on the third day but the second dose affected her more. I got my second dose a few weeks later and I was sure I was going to be in for it but strangely enough it was so much smoother than the first dose. I had arm pain but it was gone in a little over a day. I kept expecting something to happen after what my aunt went through but nothing. I had read too that younger folks have more robust immune systems but maybe I don't. I kept trying to make sense of why I felt pretty much nothing.,zettasyntax,2021-02-12 23:19:47+00:00,,0.3536752136752136,0.1015064102564102,Positive,liera2,liera2

I filled out paperwork and went back. 20 mins after I felt a rush of heat in my body and my heat rate shot up. I thought I would die. I asked him if it was normal. He said it happens to some people so I stayed awhile longer. It settled slightly but as soon as I left to walk home it shot back up again even worse. I wasn’t sure if I could make it home but I did. My stomach hurt and I was extremely cold.

This is why it’s important to continue to mask up and stay socially distant until a large percentage of the population is vaccinated. The higher the vaccinated percentage the less likely those without antibodies will catch the virus.  I’ve read that it could take anywhere from 8-16 months to get to that point.

ltpskj,Covid Vaccine Second Dose success story! Prior to the Second dose: -The week leading up to my second does I prioritized hydration and sleep (7-8 hrs)-I have a dance background so I made a plan to treat myself as though I had an injury after the shot.Second dose: 220   Moderate-mild arm sorenessZero symptoms I wore a tight shirt so I bled a bit more and they held me for 30 mins instead of 15.After my husband and I ate burgers for lunch I took 3 extra strength ibuprofens went home and took a 30 min dance hit class with a lot of boxing motions I took a long 15-20 minute hot shower and stretched in the shower then I massaged my whole body with tiger balm. Before bed I took another 3 extra strength ibuprofen and went to sleep.221: Moderate-mild arm sorenessZero symptoms Around 4am I stirred a bit feeling a little achy.I woke up at 8am and got ready for work. I had a smoothie for breakfast. This day I had an outdoor performance in 39 degree weather so I dressed warm as always (3 layers of clothes not including outerwear)Drove to work did a quick warm up and performed 6 shows from 10am-3pm. (I really feel the constant yet limited movement under all those layers really helped me). At lunch around 1pm I had a turkey sandwich and took 3 ibuprofen as my arm was starting to feel a bit sore.I came home had vegetarian Thai food for dinner took a nice hot bath with eucalyptus oil massaged my whole body again with tiger balm took 3 extra strength ibuprofen and 2 sleeping vitamins and went to bed around 9pm and woke up at 8am and I felt great lol.222: Unnoticeablemild arm soreness and zero symptomsFelt great went to work.223: No arm soreness zero symptomsStill felt great lol ran errands.Final thoughts:-Throughout this whole process I took care to stretch my arm and move it as much as possible. In so doing I have been able to lift my arm and move it with out any pain. Now a week later I have zero pain have had no symptoms and just have a tiny bruise at my injection site (which I credit to the tight armed shirt I wore smh).-I really hope this helps someone! After hearing the second dose had terrible side effects I was super anxious knowing I had to work an important and physical job the next day. Also I did nothing for the first dose and my arm was terribly sore for 4 days I felt sluggish and I had a bit of a headache. So this may have been overkill but it worked!,Traditional-Stick-15,2021-02-27 14:57:52+00:00,4.0,0.4205420466058763,0.1420339412360688,Positive,1,ltpskj

After you receive the vaccine the recommendation is to be monitored for at least 15-20 minutes after the vaccine for allergic reactions.

ghq41of,Just wanted to echo the other poster and agree that it is impossible to get infected from the mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer). As mentioned those vaccines contain no live virus at all. Instead the vaccines make your body produce surface proteins found on the outside envelope of the Coronavirus. As a result your body will have antibodies to this outside coat of the virus and will be primed against the Coronavirus if you run into it.But your body isn't making any other parts of the virus with the vaccine aside from the surface proteins. As a result you can't get an actual infection from the vaccine. So your husband is feeling crappy because your body is responding to the surface proteins made from the vaccine. The body is attacking it like an infection but there's no actual virus. Most people who do feel symptoms have them resolve by the 2nd day but let us know how he's doing!,Garfield3d,2021-01-01 16:02:55+00:00,,0.305,-0.0484848484848484,Negative,ko45fh,ko45fh

gpp8x0l,I’m sorry for your loss but this is how misinformation gets spread. There is no reason to assume that because she had a vaccine a week ago that is what caused her death. Strokes happen in the over 65 population and yes for seemingly no reason in healthy individuals. You said on your Facebook page no matter what the autopsy says you’ll say it’s the vaccine. That is ridiculous and absolutely how deaths get attributed to vaccines that aren’t attributed. So if they tell you she had an aneurysm for years nobody knew about you’re still going to go out into the world and tell people the vaccine did it? No. Listen to the autopsy and listen to science. They have no reason to lie to you about the autopsy. The person who is doing the autopsy will not be connected to big pharma they have no incentive to risk their license by lying. Please do not go around telling people a vaccine killed your MIL a week later until you know the results of the autopsy report.,Fuckyoupots,2021-03-04 21:30:18+00:00,,0.5,-0.0476190476190476,Negative,lxkrjr,lxkrjr

gqd2mdu,I totally get your concern. My best friend's dad has mitral valve prolapse as well he's 65. He doesn't have any of the other conditions you do but he was experiencing similar anxieties about his side effects and whether it would be too harsh on his body. He finally got his first shot the other day and felt totally normal :)Knowing that people with underlying health conditions were one of the most important groups to get vaccinated and most likely of utmost concern and care in the scientists' minds I wouldn't worry too much! You'll most likely feel nothing after the first shot there's almost no reported side effects from that one. And even though the second one may be quite the doozy it'll pass before you know it.I had my second shot last week I ran a fever and had the chills and aches. I may sound like a total nerd for saying this but I smiled through all the symptoms because I couldn't stop thinking about how in 2-3 uncomfortable days our bodies can create a powerful micro army that protects us from a virus that could unleash a couple uncomfortable weeks upon us  (or even months for the covid longhaulers.)That was basically a long-winded way of saying. Any uncomfortable symptoms you might feel will be more than worth the peace of mind you'll have when you're done! Oh and Tylenol is your best friend.Best of luck!

kf7vt9,I received the COVID-19 Vaccine today. Like the majority of people here I work at a hospital and was able to receive the first shot of the vaccine today. We all made appointments so it took less than five minutes from check in to injection. Hurt less than the flu vaccine hardly felt it! Prior to check in we received an information packet a consent form and a registration sheet with a QR code that is basically a health tracker to monitor our experience after for the CDC. If you register with this health tracker they will ask for you for updates every day and if you have any side effects so they can accurately monitor them. After injection of we waited inside the clinic for 15 minutes for the nurses to monitor any immediate reactions. We received a follow up appointment for our second shot at this time that is 19-23 days from the first dose (mine is 21 days from now). (We paid nothing for the vaccine) No immediate reactions for myself. No burning or swelling.

gl7r0db,And also to elaborate on what you said we don’t know a lot about covid but we do know that long term effects post covid have ruined people’s lives even if they recovered. Lungs worse than a lifelong smoker’s myocarditis and heart attacks pulmonary embolisms and strokes in 20-30 year olds. There is a lot of long term effects we are just beginning to understand and they honestly scare the shit out of me. I’m not a doctor yet I’m a student but even with what I know I can tell you the amount of excess mortality that will result from covid in the next 10 20 30+ years is going to be absolutely enormous. Say someone recovered from covid but had myocarditis and it weakened a wall in their heart they have sudden cardiac death at 50 rather than living til 70+. This is probably our reality and why even if covid DID have a 99.9% survival rate as people like to claim if someone dies of a blood clot post covid are we going to correctly attribute those deaths to covid? Just some things to think about. I’m not for fear mongering at all most people seem to be okay when they recover but many have not been and until we know more we won’t really know what we are looking at.,cobaltsteel5900,2021-01-29 09:04:56+00:00,,0.51875,0.153125,Positive,gl7nbao,l7g4br

She can wait three months but she doesn't have to- she just has to wait until she finishes her isolation phase which is 14 days and a reduction in fever with no meds.&gt; Vaccination of persons with known current SARS-CoV-2 infection should be deferred until the person has recovered from the acute illness (if the person had symptoms) and criteria have been met for them to discontinue isolation. This recommendation applies to persons who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection before receiving any vaccine doses as well as those who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection after the first dose but before receipt of the second dose. While there is otherwise no recommended minimum interval between infection and vaccination current evidence suggests that reinfection is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection. Thus persons with documented acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the preceding 90 days may delay vaccination until near the end of this period if desired.,LadybirdFarmer,2021-01-18 20:59:26+00:00,,0.4242424242424242,0.2363636363636363,Positive,gjp2v6k,kzmgjn

When patients were directly asked and followed up with they found that the side effects were more like 90% and some are permanent even after discontinuation.),Federal_Butterfly,2021-05-04 15:57:50+00:00,,0.6604166666666667,0.2427083333333333,Positive,gwx4ihg,n4a9zi

gqdzpjg,Here’s the detailed version I enrolled in a U.S. covid vaccine phase 3 trial and received my first shot Dec 3. I tested positive for COVID-19 on Dec 18 and was asymptomatic. The study personnel seemed almost giddy that they had a subject that could provide valuable data. I readily agreed to continue giving blood and saliva samples and was given an armband monitor to relay BP oxygen levels pulse etc via the internet. It meant a little bit of extra pay plus I was happy to help the study. I continued testing positive for 9 days. My first negative test was a few days before I was scheduled to receive my 2nd shot when they informed me they would not be giving it to me but would like me to stay in the study and continue providing blood and vitals. I still didn’t know whether I had received a placebo or the vaccine neither did the staff nor the attending physician. The Dr. speculated that I received the placebo since I had tested positive a couple weeks after my shot. I expressed concern that if I received the vaccine not the placebo how would I get my 2nd shot and be afforded the best protection. He said that when a vaccine became available to me they would unblind me and we could decide what my options were then. 10 days ago I received notification of availability of the Pfizer vaccine for me. I requested an unblinding and was informed that I HAD received the first dose of AZ vaccine. In early February AZ vaccine developer Oxford University released a paper stating the AZ vaccine is more effective if 2nd dose is administered 12 weeks after the first rather than original recommendation of 4 weeks apart. They also recommended you do NOT mix the AZ vaccine with other manufacturer’s vaccines. I returned to the study physician and asked if they could give me my 2nd shot as it has now been just over 12 weeks since me first. I was informed that they can not give the 2nd shot without the sponsors of the study granting a rare protocol exemption. I requested they ask for said exemption. That was 9 days ago and I am yet to receive an answer. I am stuck in limbo. The AZ vaccine is still not approved in the US. Moderna and Pfizer are and I can get one but Oxford does not recommend mixing them. I travel internationally for my work and soon will most likely be required to provide paperwork of vaccination to enter many countries. Not to mention my concern for continued protection of my health and those I come in contact with. Any suggestions or assistance is welcomed,johnocomedy,2021-03-09 23:39:03+00:00,,0.4033746556473829,0.200837924701561,Positive,m1jnwf,m1jnwf

I hate how many in med are quick to dismiss “anecdotal” evidence as hyperbole while making those who postulate feel like idiots. Let’s be clear about this.. it’s a fast moving widespread rushed production and newly advanced method for vaccination. We do not know all of the potential side effects or outcomes. It’s likely harmless to have this side effect but dismissing it as a symptom of “stress” is bullshit. My wife is stressed 247365 and her cycle has been like clockwork since she was a teenager. Stress didn’t change her menstruation cycle.It’s a trend. There’s a lot of women having this issue.

kq8qhj,"single dose delayed dose help me understand   Okay. The British government has said it might only give people the first single dose of vaccine or else delay the second one to 21 days in order for more people to get some vaccine quickly. Now my understanding was two doses were needed for full cover but I have have had people say to me that a single dose gives 95% coverage. I tried to find out the facts behind this but could only come up with the following. I understand we are in a desperate situation and some protection is better than none but I would like to sure we are not just going for a panic response and giving people the equivalent of half a boat instead of the full boat (ie giving them a reduced dose that will end up wasting resources and not protecting enough people). I would be happy for someone to explain to me the scientific thinking behind the decision even if it isn't fully tested[“The study published in the *New England Journal of Medicine*[1]( ref-1) found that vaccine efficacy between the first and second doses was 52% (95% credible interval 29.5% to 68.4%) with 39 cases of covid-19 in the vaccine group and 82 cases in the placebo group.Seven or more days after the second dose vaccine efficacy then rose to 95% (90.3% to 97.6%) with eight covid-19 cases reported in the vaccine group and 162 cases in the placebo group.”[“Pfizer said in a statement that there are ""no data"" to demonstrate that a single dose of its coronavirus vaccine will provide protection from infection after 21 days.Pfizer confirmed in response that although some protection appears to begin as early as 12 days after the first dose two doses of the vaccine — separated by three weeks — is the only regimen that proved to be 95% effective in Phase 3 trials.”""The efficacy observed after Dose 1 and before Dose 2 … cannot support a conclusion on the efficacy of a single dose of the vaccine because the time of observation is limited by the fact that most of the participants received a second dose after three weeks. The trial did not have a single-dose arm to make an adequate comparison"" the FDA document states.",Rolldal,2021-01-04 13:27:53+00:00,3.0,0.4726930014430014,0.1539448051948052,Positive,1,kq8qhj

So far Moderna and Pfizer are slated to deliver enough doses for 150 million people roughly half the country’s population but it’s unclear which companies will supply doses beyond that. The government signed contracts for more than a half-billion doses from other drugmakers but their vaccines are unlikely to earn approval this year and Americans might need to wait until June for additional doses from Pfizer.CRUCIAL QUOTE“This new federal purchase can give Americans even greater confidence we will have enough supply to vaccinate all Americans who want it by the second quarter of 2021” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Friday.,Screamimgmonkey,2020-12-31 14:36:45+00:00,,0.392016317016317,0.0495920745920746,Positive,ghg9kxg,kmaifl

gr5dxe4,Yes there were extensive trials. 43000 in the J&amp;J trials43000 in the Pfizer trial28000 in the Moderna trials These are massive studies on par with other Phase 3 trials. There are lots of reasons why the vaccines were able to be developed faster. Due to the emergency created by the pandemic companies were able to run certain phases back to back or simultaneously without the typical delays between phases. This was done at great financial risk to both the Pharma companies and governments who pre-purchased vaccines that could have failed. The nature of the pandemic itself allowed trials to be sped up. If you were testing a new measles vaccine you’d have to wait for a certain number of participants to get measles before unblinding the results. That could take years for something that is not rapidly spreading in the population but COVID very much was allowing much quicker results. THAT’s why other vaccine trials take much longer. The  concern over “long-term side effects” is unfounded because those side effects would appear quickly not years later. ,ShenhuaMan,2021-03-16 18:17:16+00:00,,0.3779879968516331,0.0871182605273514,Positive,gr5cg9j,m6blm2

gfvj7h5,I copied this from the CDC website “From 1955 to 1963 an estimated 10-30% of polio vaccines administered in the US were contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40). The virus came from monkey kidney cell cultures used to make polio vaccines at that time. Most of the contamination was in the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) but it was also found in oral polio vaccine (OPV).  After the contamination was discovered the U.S. government established testing requirements to verify that all new lots of polio vaccines were free of SV40.”SV40 causes tumors...Also most vaccines have a 10-15 year testing period before they are made available to the public. Covid has been around for less than a year so unless they have invented time travel the covid vaccine is untested compared to most other vaccines.

gkfkr9e,Have you been able to look at the data released from the phase 3 trials of each vaccine? Pfizer and Moderna both publicly published their findings. I think you can also still watch the FDA panel debate - when the FDA was considering whether to approve the vaccines they recorded their zoom meeting (lol pandemic) as the scientists and leaders discussed if the vaccine (one meeting for each vaccine) was safe or not - and then they voted and it passed!,LadybirdFarmer,2021-01-23 19:37:16+00:00,,0.4729166666666666,0.48125,Positive,l3dk84,l3dk84
gqvncf9,"I suffer from pretty bad anxiety. I've learned to convince myself to say ""fuck it"" and make myself do things that I feel like I should sometimes. The vaccine was one of them I felt like I'd be fine without it I'd just keep being safe and I'd be fine and I wouldn't have to worry about experiencing any side effects of a new vaccine. Then my coworker got covid and that scared me more than the vaccine and I realized that I just need to do it. So I did and all I got was a sore arm for both doses despite my anxiety after getting the first. (my anxiety calmed down quite a bit after it had been a few hours and I was totally fine). Another thing that really comforted me was a video on how the vaccine works I shared it on here and it's the 2nd post if you sort by top all time. And another post about how someone's family had a gathering and someone ended up having covid. All the people who weren't vaccinated got sick while NONE of the vaccinated people got sick. I thought that was pretty darn neat. I'm not saying you need to get the vaccine I just wanted to share my experience and what helped me make my decision.",marfabean,2021-03-14 07:04:41+00:00,,0.5198733365400031,0.0529020362353695,Positive,m4pyv2,m4pyv2

When you get sick normally some of your symptoms are caused by the immune response instead of the actual disease.When the virus comes into your body it will multiply.... this is why it is so dangerous.

I don't think you will have a secondary immune response after normal exposure to COVID after you have been vaccinates (I am not sure)... but you have to remember with the vaccine the target proteins are in your body in fairly large numbers at once.

m4pyv2,Fear I feel like I’m caught in this weird spot of watching those who’ve been brave enough to get the vaccine slowly start getting out again and living life those who’ve had the virus and have antibodiesseemingly less concerned about virus get out and start living again and those who have ZERO fear of the virus and refuse to wear mask continue to live life no matter what...then there’s me. I am cautious and afraid I don’t get out and do much besides shop and occasionally have dinner out - but only on a patio - I wear a mask and practice good hygiene BUT I don’t WANT to get the vaccine out of fear of the RARE but extreme side effects I’ve read about. It’s such a depressing place to be but I feel like I’m being left behind. I’m caught with one foot in each world.

gqua6nl,Hi. So from my understanding the virus has spike proteins that have mutated and evolved to be able to bind to the receptors on our cells. They actually have different kinds of spike proteins so they aren’t limited to one type of host cell receptor. Even though we have other proteins in our body that will bind to the same receptors such as hormones and what not those aren’t foreign to our immune system so they would not destroy them. Im not completely sure what you mean by there are other molecules with the spike protein. If you could clarify that I might be able to answer your question better. Also this is coming from a college student who has taken various courses in immunology virology and microbiology so I definitely don’t know everything :),Civil-Employee-3194,2021-03-13 22:15:17+00:00,,0.4511321195144724,0.0641806722689075,Positive,m4fpmp,m4fpmp

kxntz0,Moderna Vaccine Side Effect- Eye Inflammation HiThank you for the advice response is in advance. I received the COVID vaccine (Moderna) on 1110. The next day my eyes felt irritated and dry when I woke up. but nothing crazy This morning 1114 I woke up and my left eye was a mess- swollen excessively water-y painful red inflamed etc. It lasted about 2-3 hours after treating it with a warm salt water compress. I only had a headache muscle aches fatigue for the 1st 48 hours and that went away but I've never had any eye issues prior to this. Does anyone have any similar experiences? Just to clarify please do not let this deter you from getting the vaccine when you can. My eye is 100% back to normal now and my possible side effect is nothing compared to the importance of doing your part in protecting yourself and others from this disease.

lnsfdr,Second Pfizer Dose - 19 days Between doses So because of availability my second Pfizer dose was a couple of days early-- I made sure this was OK and it seems to be.I'm a healthy male in my 30's. Multiple moderate food allergies. The only reaction I've ever gotten with a vaccine was arm stiffness after an MMR about 15 years ago in college.The first Pfizer dose gave me arm stiffness in my deltoid that worsened through the day. It felt like my arm was petrifying. It was painful to sleep on that side and I definitely had some drowsiness that lasted about a day. The arm stiffness was gone before bedtime the second night.With the second dose I had expected much worse symptoms based on what I read. I had no stiffness for at least 6 hours which concerned me as I thought that maybe the vaccine wasn't stored properly and denatured. But at the 6-hour mark it hit me: moderate fatigue a moderate headache and some nausea. The arm stiffness slowly appeared and progressed by bedtime until it felt exactly like the first shot. Fairly mild symptoms. I would describe it as a mild hangover with arm pain. Nothing scary and nothing a couple of Tylenol and Melatonin didn't resolve. I'm a little over 24 hours out and there was only some slight drowsiness during the day and the arm stiffness is almost gone.,andygchicago,2021-02-19 22:41:15+00:00,2.0,0.4424074074074074,0.0120833333333333,Positive,1,lnsfdr

gplzt5i,I think you may be misreading something or not reading all the information. This is the first time that mRNA vaccines have been mass produced but not the first time they have been used on humans and the technology was developed years ago. This is direct from the CDC website: “Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades. Interest has grown in these vaccines because they can be developed in a laboratory using readily available materials. This means the process can be standardized and scaled up making vaccine development faster than traditional methods of making vaccines.mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu Zika rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine.Future mRNA vaccine technology may allow for one vaccine to provide protection for multiple diseases thus decreasing the number of shots needed for protection against common vaccine-preventable diseases.Beyond vaccines cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells.”,Elorawoahh,2021-03-04 02:51:04+00:00,,0.4493589743589744,0.1288461538461538,Positive,gplz975,lx6lih

gl1hwj4,Update. I now have lost a noticable amount of fine motor control and have some limb weakness. The twitching still continues. My nervous system feels really really wired and simultaneously exhausted. Went to the ER and they said they don't know what to test for and or what to do. Did a brain CT simple blood work and told it's a severe hypersensitive reaction follow up with my MD and good luck. I am now scheduled with a neurologist early next month and will be having a brain MRI as well. My large inflamed global reaction on my arm has visually disappeared but it itches multiple times a day in the same area even more so when it was red and angry looking.  This is honestly life changing as my hands are no longer steady and I need it for my work. I really really need this to not progress any worse.

When asked what if anything people can do before hand to help themselves the answer is always the same be well hydrated and stay well hydrated for the next several days.

ghu5wri,I know it seems like the mRNA vaccines were rushed into production but the truth is that they have been in development for about 15 years.  They started as an offshoot of DNA vaccines which have been in the works for about 25 years.  During that time we’ve perfected our techniques at genetic sequencing we’ve perfected the use of liposomes to introduce the vaccine into cells and the MERS and SARS epidemics allowed us to refine the parts of the “spike proteins” on coronaviruses to target to most effectively block infection.  Fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it SARS and MERS fizzled out without the need for a vaccine.  Even if we had had a vaccine to test at the time there weren’t enough sick people to determine whether it worked or not. There was also no incentive for people to pour the kind of money into vaccine development that has been put into covid vaccine development both from governments and the private sector.  The vaccine is safe.  It doesn’t alter your DNA it doesn’t even enter the nucleus of your cell.  It can’t give you covid.  It has no effect on fertility.  And it’s certainly safer than catching covid.  I’ve received the Pfizer vaccine and the most notable side effect was the big grin it put across my face knowing there is an end in sight.,mortois1,2021-01-02 16:25:56+00:00,,0.6156593406593406,0.2153846153846153,Positive,kotz7r,kotz7r

At the time I didn't realize that I was not technically eligible but later found a questionnaire that tells you if you are...and I am not! My husband thinks I should just do it because other people we know have been offered just when they accompanied their eligible spouse or were in the right place at the right time. What is the right thing to do? It is tomorrow should I cancel and hope someone else gets it who needs it more? Or just take the opportunity?

I immediately put cortisone cream on it. I called CDC- they were not interested  Went to Health dept and they said just out ice on it.  Apparently no one is interested in taking the info down about the side effects. The next day it was size of .50 piece.  I called my doctor and got quick apt.  and was told it was infected due to my scratching it earlier.

gsrsdgi,I'm sure you have already tried but just in case I do know that Walgreens and CVS will specifically schedule 2nd doses. (Just make sure you click that option.) But otherwise the 1st and 2nd should be the exact same medication. Just make sure that you do get the 2nd dose on the same CDC card (to show completion) and make sure it matches the same as your first. (i.e. since your first is Moderna don't let them give you Pfizer.),holdencwell,2021-03-30 05:24:51+00:00,,0.3728632478632478,0.2115384615384615,Positive,meo7s7,meo7s7

lwmbwe,Why signing up for a vaccine appointment youre not eligible for is super unethical and you should not do it I think people may believe that if you see an appointment available that isnt taken it means a vaccine dose going to waste. Therefore if you take the appointment even though you may not be eligble its helping waste. And the worst they can do is say no right? So why not sign up even if you don't meet the requirements? Here's the thing: open appointments are not wasted doses. Because clinics factor in how many appointments they have that day when they're taking out vials. So they will as close as they can make sure there are enough doses for the people they have. Which means if you sign up and they end up saying no you're not sixty five so you cant get one then they THOUGHT they had a valid appointment. And they planned for that potentially opening up another vial they didn't need to. But some clinics stick by their policy and they send you home meaning they now have a leftover dose. So by signing up when you're not supposed to you are never ever helping to reduce waste and you very well may be contributing to it. Even if a clinic can't fill all their appointments for that day they will still have those appointment doses for other days. You know how do can ethically get vaccinated and prevent waste? By picking up those leftover doses. Call around get on wait lists ask pharmacies how they handle leftover doses. Be kind to clinic workers follow their policies and you might get lucky and get called in for a leftover dose! And leftover dose truly wouldve been wasted in the trash. Nothing unethical at all about being a left over dose receiver. If you put in the work to call around you can very well help the vaccination effort by making sure nothing ends up in the trash. I just want to be clear on the difference because  people lying about eligibility is becoming a hugeee problem. And it truly is unethical and not helping waste. Be someone who is helping with leftover doses even if its more effort even if you're not guaranteed a shot. That's the only ethical way to go about getting vaccinated if you're not currently eligible. And wish yall luck in finding those leftovers truly!,Fuckyoupots,2021-03-03 05:35:53+00:00,4.0,0.4640608465608465,0.0910714285714286,Positive,1,lwmbwe

gjepntz,So there are multiple different delivery methods and you've actually mentioned two of them that are in the works! It just so happens that the mRNA vaccines like Modern and Pfizer which injects the instructions to make the spike protein got approved first.     On the other hand I think the Novavax vaccine which is in phase 3 trials in the US and UK injects the spike protein itself which your body then fights off.     Both methods are valid and hopefully we will have vaccines approved for both!,LadybirdFarmer,2021-01-16 01:33:51+00:00,,0.2847222222222222,0.0489583333333333,Positive,ky4z9n,ky4z9n

lr53bs,No side effects on first dose but flu like symptoms on second dose First dose (Pfizer) was super easy just had a sore arm but no side effects so I assumed I would be fine after my second. Got the vaccine at around 1:30pm walked around a bit ran some errands and came home. Fell asleep around 11pm and woke up at about 1am feeling nauseous possibly feverish aches all over my body and a headache. Spent the next fifteen hours in and out of sleep not leaving my bed until almost 4pm. Drank a tonne of water Gatorade went outside for a bit to cool down. Took two Advil and two Tylenol. Now it’s almost 11pm and I’m finally feeling close to normal.  Don’t assume that because you had a good first experience that your second shot will be easy as well. Obviously I’m still glad I got it because feeling shitty for one day is way better than getting covid.

lbi07u,"What is preventing people who have high risk of contracting the virus or have a condition not listed as ""high risk"" from claiming they smoke in order to get the vaccine earlier? In New Jersey smoking is listed as an underlying condition and high risk when other things that should also be listed aren't. Everything else that puts people higher on the list is provable such as occupation as a frontline worker or other medical conditions such as obesity or diabetes. But is smoking really provable? How long would someone have to have smoked for in order for it to be an underlying condition and would they need a doctor's note for that?My boyfriend has asthma and even a common cold or a bad allergy day can be completely debilitating to him and mean a trip to the hospital if he can't get it under control in time. Yet asthma isn't listed as an underlying condition. What would prevent him from simply claiming he smokes in order to get the vaccine sooner?My mom is a school teacher and her school is making the teachers come into school even if they have doctor's notes for conditions that put them at high risk. They make her teach from her office and she doesn't see students in person but other teachers have still gotten sick and one of them has been in and out of the hospital since late October. That teacher's family can't even sue the district for negligence because there isn't a way to prove she got sick at school even though the teacher never left the house for any other reasons. My mom is almost 60 and is too young to retire and probably wouldn't receive unemployment if she left the school and almost certainly wouldn't be able to get her job back again once it's safe. So what prevents her from saying she started smoking and getting the vaccine to protect herself? What about family members of front line workers who aren't as at risk themselves? Or family members of high risk individuals? They're not on the list so what actually is preventing them from saying they smoke in order to get the vaccine sooner in order to protect themselves and their loved ones? What proof does anyone need to offer that they smoke in order to claim it as an underlying condition?",thisshitsux13679,2021-02-03 07:06:15+00:00,6.0,0.4621876932591218,-0.0197263450834879,Negative,1,lbi07u

lwpytn,First dose of Maderna: side effects are sucking My institution is providing vaccines to all medical and custody staff. I’ve had COVID and it was the most terrifying time of my life. I went o work “a little tired”. By 3 hours in I felt like a truck hit me and it was all downhill from there. Ended up on oxygen for a week and have lasting issues with breathing 4 months out. I got my shot at 0830 on 32 and went home and to sleep in preparation for work that night. I was told that those susceptible to side effects with other vaccines (like the flu shot) will have more noticeable issues like body aches and fever. I was also told by the tech when I asked her opinion (being a COVID survivor and a little worried about risks) that those who had COVID tend to react significantly more strongly (in correlation with how bad their symptoms were) but it’s only for 24 to 48 hours so worth it in the long run. I figured it’s only 24 to 48 hours of body aches and maybe a fever. I can do it might not make it through work without adjusting my post but I’ll be fine and knowing it’s only 48 hours max it will be far easier. I woke up at 1800 for work and was a little tired and the injection site was sore. Whatever it’s the end of the work week so I’m typically a little tired and every vaccine leaves some soreness. Holy shit. At midnight I felt like I did when I first had COVID symptoms. I was at work but in an easy low movement post and figured I’m not moving much so I can tough it out. Never have I known of anyone sent home sick aside from when they requested it. Additionally my post partner understood and picked up more of the load knowing I would do the same if the roles were reversed. By 2am I couldn’t move from the muscle aches and I had a bad headache concentrated near my neck and it was way too obvious. My supervisor sent me home on sick pay and told me to call when I got there safe. I’m now home and calming down from a panic attack. I’m irrationally terrified I have COVID and just started showing symptoms the same day of my shot (I’m over 100 days out). I’m sore I have a headache I’m exhausted and have brain fog it’s terrifying and terrible. I had some juice to prove I can still taste citrus (the first taste I lost) and it’s strong so I just called my doctors nursing line instead of going to the overnight clinic. They reassured me I’m fine told me to come in if in 72 hours it hasn’t reduced and they will test me. They suggested anti-inflammatories rest and hydrate. I know I’m being crazy but the fear is there. And I in no way say the vaccine maybe gave me COVID (impossible) but working at a closed custody prison the risk of contracting it is always there and I’m scared i became symptomatic today by coincidence. I’ll update as time goes by. And even though they say the second is worse I’m still getting it. I will not stand by and risk contracting it and passing it on again when there is a vaccine available.Update: So day 2 (332021) was absolutely terrible. I felt so much more soreness and I slept non-stop it felt like. My clothes and blankets rubbing on my skin felt like sandpaper (which I went through with COVID too). So I called in again. I was so hopeful that day 3 would be a magical end as I’ll be out of the 48 hour window. I got a call from the CDC due to my answers on the V-Safe questionnaire and was told they would check in again today. Today (342021) I woke up at around 0530 hours so around 45 hours post vaccine. I felt 100% fine! I’m actually going to see if I can pick up some hours at work tonight to make up for the missed 16 hours from trying to survive the side effects. I do want to note a few things: 1) I had COVID on 11162020 so my immune system is barely past the 90 day window and probably reacted so hard because it was ready to attack strong. 2) I had COVID pretty bad. Almost got admitted to the hospital due to reduced SpO2 levels and breathing difficulties. So that maybe had something to do with it?3) Despite the pain and personal fears I am still a very strong advocate for the vaccine. I continue to encourage my coworkers to get on the list for vaccination while they are still coming to the facility. I will be first in line on the day my second dose is scheduled but did request the second day after off (just in case). 4) I react to the flu shot every year with a fever and mild body aches for a day. So that may also have helped out a bit. I also get the Pneumonia vaccine annually per my Doctor’s suggestion and it causes pretty severe pain at the injection site and along my arm for a few days. Probably didn’t help out. But the vaccine is better then getting it for real.,Fralto,2021-03-03 09:38:00+00:00,11.0,0.537642328042328,-0.0422957671957672,Negative,1,lwpytn

gitue9q,True but I have to think there is more chance of me spreading it if I have an active symptomatic case. Plus we learn new things all the time. We went from the CDC saying please don't wear and buy up masks the only ones that work are the N95s anyway so save those for hospital workers. Then they said wear masks it won't help you to not get covid but it will help you to not give it now they say masks protect both others around you and you yourself from covid.

m1brel,pretty freaked out first dose in a couple days Hi Guys 22 year old male&amp; x200B;I get my first shot of Pfizer in a couple days im very worried. All my friends who have gotten it are healthy young people so their side effects were very normal and moderate at worst. But i dont read anything about people with conditions getting it and dont know much about their experiences&amp; x200B; Im very scared to get the vaccine. I have a heart condition (mitral valve prolapse) as well as beta thalassemia anemia and a liver condition called gilberts syndome. I usually run warm temps every night as well (99.2-99.6) Daytime  morning temp is mostly normal (98-98.6) &amp; x200B;All these things combined have me very worried. Im worried my side effects will be very serious due to my health conditions and due to my temp running warmer during the nights anyway.&amp; x200B;I feel doomed if i get vaccinated and doomed if i dont. I dont wanna get this shot and have 104 fever with a rushing heart for days on end or need to go the ER. But I dont want covid either lol. I seem to do bad with viruses the flu had me bed ridden for 12 days with 102.7 fever mono had me bed ridden for 4 days with 101-103.9 fever.&amp; x200B;The rational side of me knows vaccines are very safe and im sure ill survive this and be fine and glad i did it. But sadly im still anxious. &amp; x200B;I dont know why im posting this on here but it feels better to put it somewhere rather than going crazy inside.

l4gsh2,Experience after second dose of moderna Hi all I just received my second dose of moderna today. With my first dose I had mild symptoms of body aches joint pain fatigue arm soreness but it was all very tolerable &amp; went away within 2-3 days. Now my second dose though... I feel like I got hit by a train right now. About 12 hours post second dose I had muscle aches body pain arm soreness &amp; developing fever. At first it was mild 100.4 101 102.9 etc but now I’m 16 hours post injection &amp; my fever is 104 &amp; I’ve been rolling in bed for the past hour trying to sleep but the aches &amp; constant shiveringchills are preventing that. I’m trying to bear with it &amp; avoid taking Tylenol because I’ve been seeing around that NSAIDs may decrease the immune system response and in turn affect the efficacy of the vaccine. Just wanted to share my experience &amp; see if anyone else also experienced something similar and how long it lasted. I know the second dose of the vaccine tend to produce a stronger immune response which leads to all these symptoms I’m having and that this means the vaccine is working and doing its job properly.,206932584,2021-01-25 05:21:48+00:00,0.0,0.2873949579831933,0.126610644257703,Positive,1,l4gsh2

krth4r,"Pfizer Vaccine - Receiving 2nd dose on 23rd day after 1st dose Hi everyoneDue to late shipment issue my 2nd dose was scheduled (not by me) to the 23rd day after I received my 1st. It just didn't arrive in the morning but is coming only 2 hours after my scheduled appointment. According to the people who are giving the vaccine the 17-21 day period is ""more like 17-23 days"" and I can't really find anything that really supports that. I'm frustrated because it was only the morning appointments that got moved to past the 21 days and they kept the rest of the appointments as scheduled. I don't think that's fair especially when they were insisting that we needed to get it done by the 21st day and wouldn't even let us schedule past that before. Now all of a sudden it's okay to get it on the 23rd day? I work in healthcare directly with patients and am high risk.

gjl8jtz,This article is good. Not good in the way that it's informative because almost everything in it is an artifact generated by computer modeling and the author either being a willfully misleading doomer or simply ignorant of what he's trying to make a point about. Thus the entire thing is about as closely modeled to reality as a round of online gameplay in the latest entry of the Call Of Duty computer game series.It's good in the way that it shows why experts aren't worth shit anymore and why public trust in institutions are in free fall.The author of the article. Never heard his name before but he's a Professor in Cell Biology. So on paper he's qualified to say something of value. But the content of the paper reads like something from a guy picking fruit onto the shelves in a supermarket would create. Or an AI generated mess created by cut and paste snippets from a collection of doomer news media pieces.First and most glaring problem? Most of his sources are news media articles. He posts two things that have any value One is a 2011 article about maintaining herd immunity( [ )(Note here that creating herd immunity is not the same as terminating a pandemic). The other thing of marginal value he posts is a modeling study( [ ) where someone thinks it's a good idea to model R0 values based on reported covid deaths only. Like the author of the article these people are really into the R0 value which is probably the most misunderstood value of the entire pandemic and the least useful one today. The R0 value is the Basic Reproduction Value how many people are infected in an ignorant population with no innate immunity no acquired immunity and no awareness or restrictions to their normal life and social functioning. Pretending R0 is super significant a year after the start of a pandemic is like advertising that your brothel had a really high rate of virgins when they started working there 10 years ago.What matters is the current reproduction value simple R how many people does a person infect TODAY? If it's over 1 the cases go up if it's less than 1 cases go down. As R values in many places are just a bit above 1 and in some places even below 1. We don't need to vaccinate 70% of the population like the author suggests we could in fact simply wait and the numbers will decrease anyway vaccinations speeds this process up and allowing targeted protection of the most frail. But that isn't in line with the doomer storytelling the author wishes to convey that despite the vaccine we're going no-where.,vivehelpme,2021-01-17 14:17:51+00:00,,0.4435496031746032,0.1569861111111111,Positive,kz2q7j,kz2q7j

l210rw,"Anyone else having ""uncommon"" side effects weeks on? So before I start I think I should say I'm not anti-vax or writing this to put anyone off having the vaccine. I simply want some advice or to find anyone else who's feeling similarly. I have my flu jab annually without any problems. I had my vaccine on the 5th of this month. The same day I had the common side effects of a (very) painful arm and the next day I felt pretty tired and had a bad headache but seemed fine. Over the last week I've noticed that I don't feel quite right but it's been a bunch of low grade kind of unnoticeable symptoms if you view them separately. So I've not put them together until today.I made the connection that these things only started after the vaccine. So I looked up to see if there's more info on long term side effects and I find an article and there's a list of uncommon side effects for the Oxford vaccine (I had the Pfizer) and I have almost all of those symptoms: * Nausea* Loss of appetite* Itchy skin (my legs have been so itchy that I scraped the skin off and grazed them!)* Dizziness* Enlarged lymph nodes.It also seems to have slightly aggravated a condition I have and has made me feel more tired than I usually do. I thought it was anaemia so I took an iron tablet which normally gives me a pick me up the next day but there's still this residual fatigue.It doesn't give any further information about when these symptoms should stop if it's safe to take the second vaccine if I should seek medical support etc. It says symptoms can last upto a week after the vaccine but obviously mine's lasted longer.I'm wondering if I should contact a doctor about my symptoms or do I have to just deal with them for now and hope they go away? I really hope things improve with time. Anyone else finding they have the same symptoms?",AuroraTheObscurer,2021-01-21 15:50:43+00:00,14.0,0.4578643578643578,0.0613852813852813,Positive,1,l210rw

gqkybfe,"I'd get the vaccine. Its crazy how easy it is to schedule an appointment at a pharmacy. I know various people who have found appointments at like a Walgreens CVS Kroger etc and just checked the ""two or more health conditions"" box in the appointment sign up and when they show up at the pharmacy for an appointment it's pretty much no questions asked. I talked to a family friend who is a pharmacist and he claimed they legally can't look up your medical history so if you checked that that box they pretty much have no choice but to take your word for it. At the end of the day it's probably wrong to jump the line but at the same time-- it's one more vaccine in a persons arm.Once everyone figures out how easy it is everyone is going to start doing it.

gpl8vu7,Hello! I have a pretty severe needle phobia as well and I just got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Sunday. I’m not sure if these tips will be relevant to you but I wanted to share them in case! It only feels like a little stinging poke and lasted no more than 5 seconds. If the pain aspect of needles bothers you icing the spot or giving it a pinch right before are great ideas. You could also purchase a topical numbing creamgel at any drugstore.For me it’s not about the pain but about the needle being in my body. To combat this I like to chat as casually as possible with the nurse about literally anything else... in this case she saw my 21st birthday was coming up so I asked her if she had any recommendations for places that serve good drinks in our area. Anything will do I just find that those conversations distract me from thinking about the needle for a few minutes before I get it. Some people have told me to tell the nurse about the fear but honestly the “fake it until you make it” approach has been much more successful. I hope it goes well for you!,floras_secret,2021-03-03 22:56:16+00:00,,0.6393298059964726,0.1908730158730158,Positive,lx2nhk,lx2nhk

gx20lt7,I was nervous too but I got mine last week (J&amp;J) and I’m completely fine now! For about 24 hours I was feeling under the weather didn’t sleep well mild headache low energy but then after 1-2 days I really felt back to normal and completely fine. 30F on birth control for reference. Biggest advice is: 1. HYDRATE! Before getting it and 48 hours after. I mean really hydrate. Alternate between water electrolyte drink like Pedialyte or low sugar Powerade or something similar water again. 2. Move around your arm after the shot during your 15-minute monitoring period. It’ll help with soreness. Try to continue to move it around all day in circles or lifting small things up. 3. Take it easy but go on walks if you’re up for it. 4. Deep breaths! In the very off chance you have severe symptoms (from what I’ve read you’ll know they are severe) don’t hesitate to contact a doctor asap even just to check in. That said it is more than likely you will be 100% fine. Most people experience side effects for 24 hours and maybe have to take a Tylenol but then they are fine. Keep in mind most people come to these threads when something goes wrong not the millions for who things went right. That’s uneventful and not noteworthy. Deep breaths get some extra sleep if you can and HYDRATE. You’ll do great!,treadthoughts,2021-05-05 18:21:02+00:00,,0.443686224489796,0.1826743197278911,Positive,n5k1lj,n5k1lj

By day 4 the sore throat was a bit worse. It's now day 5 and I am feeling fatigued again and the sore throat is even worse. I have been taking paracetamol but it doesn't seem to be making much of a difference.I guess I could have picked up another illness around the time I had the vaccine but it doesn't seem likely as I haven't been ill in over a year I'm fastidious about hygiene and I barely leave the house or meet anyone.

Went to bed woke up feeling ok.Again after I ate felt same heartburn pain. Anyone experience any symptoms like this?

klk218,Possible strange reaction to Pfizer vaccine This is going to sound really strange but I’ll ask it anyway. I got the Pfizer Covid vaccine a week and a half ago and developed a very irritated white head “pimple” beside the injection site the next day. One week later I develop the exact same type of white head on the lateral part of my lower leg. Both were small white heads painful red swollen and lasted 2-3 days. I never have pimples (even when I was a teen) and thought it was strange.

n2yl9o,Heart palpitations 3 days after first Pfizer vaccine The only side effect I had from the vfizer vaccine was heart palpitations started 3 days after and hasn't gone away. It has nearly been 4 weeks since the first jab and for now I have decided to not have the second one. I have experienced a few palpitations in my life time (maybe 1 palpitation per year) and now I experience well over 100 per day. I am healthy 28 year old female with no medical history. These heart palpitations have made me think I am going die on multiple occasions. I know that's crazy but when you get like 10 intense palpitations in a row it makes me wonder if my heart is going to go back to normal or if im just going to pass then and there. I can handle the isolated palpitations but when the heart isn't refilling in-between it's so scary affects my breathing and makes me anxious. The doc has ordered a whole lot of tests and now we are just waiting on the results. I have started to take magnesium and calcium to try relieve the heart palpitations. Surely this can't be normal I just pray all the time that it will go away soon. Please let me know if you have had any similar experiences.,Anna_grace1993,2021-05-02 03:58:44+00:00,17.0,0.491919191919192,0.075,Positive,1,n2yl9o

m6tthg,I have horrible health anxiety and I'm terrified to get second dose of Pfizer. Looking for advicereassurance? I know the vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and I'm going to go through with the second dose no matter what my anxiety tells me. But I am so freaked out that I'll be one of those few people who has some kind of freak reaction and dies. It doesn't help that I stumbled upon an article about a 39-year-old Utah mom with no underlying conditions who died days after getting her second dose. That in addition to all the other crap from internet conspiracy theorists that I shouldn't be reading.For now I'm just trying to find a way of thinkingrationalizing with myself that I'm making the right decision and I don't need to worry about the vaccine somehow killing me.Does anyone else struggle with health anxiety or share similar fears?

I could not move walk or sit without screaming in pain. Now im not sure if it is related to the vaccine but I’m scheduled to get the second dose soon and I don’t know if I want to get it.

gl4p56f,Do you know how many people are tested for the average drug or vaccine? How can you possibly say that 40000 is low? This is a larger testing pool than many other drugs or vaccines already licensed.I’m not suddenly stopping wearing a mask because I’ve had a vaccine I’ll be socially distancing wearing a mask and washing my hands just as regularly. Actually I was told by the person giving me the vaccine that I can still catch and spread the virus but that I’m less likely to be seriously ill thanks to taking it. Of course that’s wrong though because you the person who hasn’t even had the vaccine  is telling me what happens when you go and get the vaccine? Riiiiiiight...Again I did do my research I was going to wait a year to see the long term effects but it’s all about weighing up what’s right for you. As a front line worker with people with the virus I am far more likely to contract it and worse; spread it to the families I’m working with. Big pharma are linked to the government and of course they’re paying them nicely for all of this -just as they’re doing with PPE companies currently in the UK. They make their money off keeping sick people sick for a whole lot of it hence why the states have such a horrific time with Opiate addiction. I know what big pharma are like as again I did my research. At the end of the day it comes down to one thing -you risk the vaccine or you risk the virus and I chose to risk the vaccine. No one is making you get it; in fact no one cares what you do. Do what’s right for you and your family and maybe just maybe don’t go to subreddits to argue with people who have chosen differently than you in the mean time?,Mrsmoopiethethird,2021-01-28 19:00:15+00:00,,0.5520716619981326,-0.0465744631185807,Negative,gl4leuj,l6qn4n

mfdtjm,Moderna Vaccine and Biopsy My grandma (83 yrs old) got her 2nd Moderna vaccine on wednesday and about 24 hours later she got a lung and bone biopsy done. The day of her biopsies she didnt have any major side effects from the vaccine besides a slight fever (99.7 degrees fahrenheit) and fatigue. Of course after the biopsies she was in a lot of pain but nothing too bad. She did explain that she was freezing as the recovery room she was in for a few hours after the procedure was so cold. She refused to eat and just fell into deep sleep until the next morning. Ever since yesterday (Saturday) she has been having an extreme headache with fevers that come and go (tends to go away taking tylenol extra strength) and cant seem to digest any of the food she eats. She threw up twice earlier today. She also is having chills. Whenever she eats she gets a terrible headache and nausea later which are side effects of indigestine.Do her symptoms sound like side effects of the 2nd Moderna vaccine? or could it be a possible upcoming cold due to being very freezing in the hospital? I'm not sure if its from the vaccine or not because it did come a few days later. Any recs on what to do?,swimpuppy49,2021-03-29 00:31:30+00:00,8.0,0.4040509259259259,-0.1335069444444444,Negative,1,mfdtjm

gr28mna,Ok firstly sorry for your losses. It's no exaggeration for me to say that those family members have been murdered by your government and the people who rule over them who instigated Operation Covid. Hospitals were aware from very early on that people were dying from being put on ventilators but they were incentivized with money to get patients on them as well as paid for Covid deaths. Many people died in hospitals due to negligence and greed. Do not resuscitate orders were the norm..does that seem right?Question: there are medicines that are absolutely proved to help SARS Covid that have been known about for a long time. I doubt any of these were offered to your family. Why? :'Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread'Ivermectin:'a marked reduction of self-reported anosmiahyposmia a reduction of cough and a tendency to lower viral loads and lower IgG titers which warrants assessment in larger trials.'Hydroxycholraquine:'The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.''These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections.'Zinc Vitamin C and Vitamin D3 are all superb at preventing and fighting Covid infections. Why weren't government spending their money sending packages of these out to everyone or at least the weaker elements of society instead of closing down the world and destroying economies?Because it's nothing to do with a virus..it's about control. The laboratory modified virus was something that was entirely treatable but the controllers of the medical establishment gave false instructions to hospitals and well...you know the horrible conclusion.The vaccine is next part of the culling. Get yourself on the vitamins above if you fear Covid and avoid the shot at all costs.,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-15 22:25:11+00:00,,0.4944949494949495,0.054520202020202,Positive,gqxterf,m4u0yt

lssk70,"RN here still unable ro receive the vaccine!!! What is going on?!?!?! I have been an RN for around 13 years now and work full time at a hospital. Though I work on the heart floor and not the covid floor we get patients all the time that we will take care of for several days then next thing you know their send out results come back and are positive. So now not only us nurses but the other patients we have been taking care of at the same time have been exposed. I live in a very conservative state so when the vaccine came out many healthcare workers were saying they were opting out of it (they didn't trust it for a myriad of reasons.) Not me though! I was ready for my jab. So i waited for the announcement saying I could get it...and waited...and waited...and waited some more. The way I finally learned that it was being given was a front page picture on the local newspaper showing the doctors ceo and ""higher-ups"" receiving their first doses. After doing some sleuthing I learned our floor manager did not make the announcement to us because she was one of those who did not believe in the vaccine and figured most of us didn't as well. Next thing I knew our state ran out so it was a waiting game again.Finally the next month I got an e-mail saying I could call a number and make an appointment for the next round. I called as soon as I got home but all spots had been filled.I sent an e-mail to the person in charge explaining my situation and asking if I could go ahead and be put on a list for the next round being that now we had moved on from healthcare workers and there were more people out in the community getting it. I basically got a lecture about waiting so long and how I should have signed up first chance I got.Finally last week my chance came and I was signed up to get my first vaccine this week! I felt so relieved. But being my luck I also came down with a uti and had to be put on antibiotics making me no longer eligible at this time 😞Sorry just had to rant",Rollersk885,2021-02-26 07:30:59+00:00,10.0,0.3339035516454872,0.0619542196155099,Positive,1,lssk70

l0bsoz,"Post-Vaccination Plans I'm curious to know what everyone's post-vaccination plans are.  To me it seems like those of us who are able and who have been vaccinated should try to return to as close to our post-pandemic lives as possible.  Yes I understand that mask-wearing and social distancing should still be practiced (and I plan to).  But I also plan on leaving my home more and engaging in riskier activities (shopping eating out travel etc.).  These are my reasons:  * Being vaccinated I'm now less likely to get infected myself and I'm less likely to infect others.* The world needs to function.  All of the people currently working in the industries where pandemic has impacted aren't doing so because they're rich... they're just trying to survive.  By spending my money in these areas it's helping to keep these industries in function.* People need to feel ""normal"".  Not only myself but others as well.  Seeing others returning to normal can help others feel like things are slowly beginning to return to normal.There's also part of me that thinks there is other stuff we should be doing.

Remember to stay in the center itself for at least 15 minutes after the shot just incase you have an allergic reaction. For the majority its the 2nd dose that's rougher but it's not a rule.

gstuk6s,I just read the same article today about having covid and the second shot may neutralize the immunity.  I am going to send it to my son who was sick as a dog from his moderna shot and thought that he may have had covid and not known it.  My oldest sister was around my whole family sick with covid and she never got sick so I am thinking that he could be immune to it or just an asymptomatic carrier. They were saying to get an antibody test done before the 2nd shot and if they are high to not get it.

gloyc87,So my first thought is a basic blood type-dependent response. O and negative types like COVID would be more likely to be asymptomatic and anyone else would get the rough end of things.My other hypothesis is a bit more complex and was brought on by my mom saying she’s been having vivid dreams since her shot. The only time I experienced something like that was when I was trying to quit smoking and left a patch on overnight. Weird vivid dreams. That led me to think given the [COVID spike protein’s afffinity for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]( could those side effects be explained by that? Smokers who’ve recently quit have a higher number of nAChRs than the average person and thus would experience harsher side effects. Non or never smokers also run a risk of having a rough time. Smokers vapers users of nicotine bupropion or Chantix (also activate nAChRs) would be less likely to experience the harsh side effects since their receptors are otherwise occupied. Again probably wrong and there’s no correlation but thought I’d sample some data anyway.,Peach_tree,2021-02-02 04:14:13+00:00,,0.55,0.0047101449275362,Positive,lan0il,lan0il

ghpvm11,"I've never contracted COVID (and obviously don't plan to) and live in Florida where getting the vaccine is close to impossible.... but it sounds as if you're essentially putting the COVID vaccine into a host body that currently has active COVID as a total layperson here. Studies and news reports I've seen recommended not getting the vaccine until it's been cleared from your body hence the 90 day ""plan"" and the hospital changed their policies on who should get it and when (not surprising given the general ineptitude surrounding everything COVID related in the US). How effective would the COVID vaccine be if you currently have COVID? I'm guessing here based on what I've read but it would seem any empirical evidence on efficacy is sketchy and I'd assume you still have it and that the vaccine might help or might not given you sound like you have an active case right now.

Even condoms and birth controls fail. Also it’s important to realize that vaccines work as good as your immune system allows it to. What if those 4 people have low immune system? How can they form antibodies to “protect” them from covid? The answer is they can’t. There are so many pieces in play that we cannot just base our decision on the news without getting more information. I would recommend you to speak to a physician before finalizing your decision. To vaccinate or not I believe is an individuals choice.

ghx9idq,The science behind this vaccine is so flawed it makes no since that your body should internally make something that a virus creates on its own it seems if your own immune cells are making the antigen of the virus the antibodies that are created from that will either be auto immune and attack the antigen your making or do nothing when the real virus comes. Your mingling this viral RNA with your immune system this is not a vaccine this is symbiosis with a virus you better trust your instincts and stop being a guinea pig.

Perhaps I’ve had it since the vax but I didn’t notice it until after I tried to be active lol.

m1qrl9,Johnson vaccine and painful body aches I got the Johnson vaccine yesterday and didn’t feel much but the next day I woke up groggy with painful body aches after that morning that pain intensified on my right arm specifically which is the opposite arm I got the shot on. It comes in waves where it’s fine for about a minute or 2 then it’s painful for about the same amount of time. It’s so painful that I can’t do anything but hold my arm until the pain stops. Has anyone else experienced something similar and if so what did you do to help it. I already took some Tylenol but it did little to nothing.,At11ok,2021-03-10 05:57:47+00:00,3.0,0.5200549450549451,-0.0988553113553113,Negative,1,m1qrl9
gqzygy3,You get a vaccine passport over here they give it to you with the second dose however. Do people lie about getting the vaccine? Yes people can lie. But why do you care? I know that people over here (U.A.E - Dubai) do it because work places are pressuring people to get vaccinated. Some like the one my brother works at even tied some of his benefits to getting vaccinated so he lied and said he got the first shot on the official form. No proof until you get the second and he gets his full wage that way until his appointment. Also the form is an on-line own with yes first dose Yes second dose (upload passport info) No (lose a part of your wage for the month). The fact that he got covid in early feb and therefor had to delay his appointment for three months by law is not taken into consideration.,Kidlike101,2021-03-15 10:19:28+00:00,,0.3145833333333333,0.19375,Positive,m5f3hn,m5f3hn

My 2nd is already scheduled at CVS in Texas for 319.  This would be fine of course but my work just notified me I’m being put on another project back in AZ. Guess what?  AZ is way behind and I’m not even eligible there yet.  Any ideas on what I should do?  Also it’s a 20 hour round trip drive from AZ project location to original TX shot location can’t do it.

gg79x5n,I’m not really the best person to ask but my opinion is that the US needs to take the advise of the CDC and health officials. Other countries have done this (and have seen results) - maybe then we could get there but right now our numbers are proving that the majority of people are unable to mask up and keep socially distanced. I have friends from various countries and the comparison between their daily cases and ours is astounding. In my state we average 2000+ cases a day there are COUNTRIES that haven’t seen those numbers in months and are “back to normal” because they took quarantine seriously.

This will help the sorenessstiffness be gone quickly. I did this right away after my shot (11am) and it was moderately sore that day and only mildly sore the next. By two days post shot it was totally gone. My friends who didn’t do that were very sore for multiple days. You’ll do great!

gr2fjzy,Ok so I believe a pathogen exists and even in the long version of whatever it is.  I'm not sure if it's around any more but that could differ depending on the country and the devious plan that is still unfolding. What I do know however is that irrespective of whether you can get short Covid long Covid big Covid small Covid or Covid with extra fries the vaccine is still a BIO-WEAPON and is far more dangerous to your body. Non mainstream virus experts are talking about ten ways in which the 'depop shot' could really affect you negatively and in the case of the elderly or feeble death is a real possibility.My advice is to get lots of Vitamin C Vitamin D3 Zinc and maybe some Quercetin. Eat healthy be active and live your life. The establishment have shut down the actual cures. Read these mainstream articles and you'll see that these things work:'Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread'Ivermectin:'a marked reduction of self-reported anosmiahyposmia a reduction of cough and a tendency to lower viral loads and lower IgG titers which warrants assessment in larger trials.'Hydroxycholraquine:'The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.''These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections.'Now ask yourself why they weren't given to people and why fact checkers are all over the shop trying to say negative things about them that are false?,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-15 23:39:31+00:00,,0.479563492063492,0.0356240981240981,Positive,gr1rfnt,m4u0yt

l8kw9e,Muscle spams 1day post-second dose Moderna So I had a nasty back muscle spasm the evening following the day I got the second dose.I am prone to back spasms.  History: My spine is absolutely trashed from Army I was airborne infantry &amp; special operations.  Since I was medically discharged 7 years ago with degenerative disc disease scoliosis 8 herniated discs.  Things have been getting better in the last 2 years by being extremely careful.  I've definitely gained alot of weight as a result but I have made peace that I am very disabled and I have come a long ways from the awful days where I needed help doing basic things because movements like twisting my torso to reach my seatbelt would throw me out for a week.But infection always brings back the telltale tenderness in my back that it's about to go down.  I am thinking the vaccine mounted that same non-specific inflammatory immune response in my back.  I woke up with an ache in my lower left lat.  That evening I was seated on the ground organizing paperwork into piles I twisted and before I knew what happened I was on the ground writing in pain howling and no position I moved to gave me any relief.  The more I moved the more it hurt.  It was hell.  I went to urgent care and did my old routine: muscle relaxers and aleve and I am usually back on my feet in a couple days.  This one feels like it will be a longterm recovery.  I feel like the clock has been set back to Army days.  I see physical therapy this morning.You muscle spasm people take care of yourselfs just lay in bed please.,VzPoppers,2021-01-30 12:41:01+00:00,0.0,0.3210290093048713,-0.0313245758073344,Negative,1,l8kw9e

gqf5jbv,Hi!27(f) with extreme anxiety. I’ve had to stay an extra 20-30 minutes after a simple doctors appointment because I’ve had panic attacks over *nothing* so I was V E R Y nervous getting my first Pfizer vaccination. I waited about 10 minutes (totally sweating and shaking uncontrollably in the lobby) got poked and had to wait 15 minutes after the injection. I honestly think having to wait that 15 minutes after the shot helped. I immediately called my sister to release my anxiety and calm me down then went on my phone and distracted myself. Then boom. Done. I had 0 symptoms (besides arm soreness) even though the handful of people who got it all had very bad migraines after. I totally understand you. I hope this helps.,SignificantCamel8516,2021-03-10 06:33:46+00:00,,0.6096031746031745,-0.0040555555555555,Negative,m1brel,m1brel

gi4qa9h,It's one of those things where at the end of the day you have to outweigh what you are more scared of getting covid or getting the vaccine and also look at how at risk you are. I am also both scared to death of the virus and also the vaccine. I have OCD and anxiety so this last year has been quiet a challenge for me. I have stopped reading too much or too deep into both the virus and vaccine. I work in behavioral healthcare at residential facility and last week I was given the opportunity to get the moderna vaccine and I didn't overthink it and kind of impulsively just went for it and got one of 4 doses that were available to us. I was feeling kind of strange for two days kind of fuzzy or just off and very fatigued. Arm hurt very bad. On day 3 I was feeling 100 percent again.

mhj0e2,Pfizer second dose I just got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine Monday. The first dose I had chills the evening after getting the shot about 6 hours after. I also had body aches and a low fever. The next day I was  achey and had no energy. Injection site pain was pretty uncomfortable I couldn't sleep on that side. I also had swollen dose I had chills the evening after getting the shot about 6 hours after. I also had body aches and a low fever. The next day I was achey and had no energy. Injection site pain was pretty uncomfortable I couldn't sleep on that side. I also had swollen lymph nodes in my neck and armpit and groin. The second day after I was pretty much back to normal. The only thing that lingered was the pain at the injection site and swollen glands that took a few days to go down.Dose two I got Monday afternoon. I went to bed feeling fine with only a very slight sore arm although I was unusually cranky. I woke up at 5:00 a.m. Tuesday with fever chills body aches and nausea. I threw up a few times throughout the morning and had to cancel a client meeting and push some work off for a few days. I had a fever on and off all day  yesterday and pretty much slept all day. My fever peaked at 101 and came with all of the fun fever symptoms. I also had a really bad headache that turned into a migraine yesterday afternoon but I'm on migraine medication so that could have been just a regular migraine. Absolutely no energy yesterday I had to water my garden which is a low stress easy chore and it wiped me out. Today I feel much better. No fever but I'm still very tired and achy. My lymph nodes are also swollen. The node under my armpit is golf ball sized and is insanely uncomfortable. I don't even want to put my arm down or use it to pick anything up. I also have swollen nodes in my breasts which is no fun. Have a headache but it isn't migraine level. And still no energy. I walked to the edge of my VERY SHORT driveway and got weak and sick feeling coming back in lol. I feel like I've aged 50 years. Hoping I feel better tomorrow. Supposedly it can take up to six weeks for the lymph nodes to go back to normal. I sincerely hope that isn't the case for me.I still would get it but damn it sucks. I hope we don't need a booster every year. Really this post is just for me to whine.

Here is how:1. They show long lines of cars and people waiting hours for their chance at a shot. (So many of my friends say it is not worth the trouble)2. They talk endlessly about the side effects and give people who had very unusual severe side effects an overly large audience.3. They keep asking the experts if the vaccine works against the mutants and when the experts say the current vaccine works against these variants the media acts like they did not hear them and keep hyping doubt that the current vaccine will be worthless.4. They keep saying that it is doubtful that the COVID vaccine will stop the spread of the virus so we will have to keep wearing masks and social distance forever. (This gives us less incentive to be vaccinated.)5. They keep promoting the people who got the virus after their first shot and act like this is very common.6. They keep talking about how it is impossible to get an appointment for a vaccine and talk mostly to people who failed or got one but was then canceled.The average person is now completely confused and angry and likely is saying -WHY BOTHER!,LogObvious9498,2021-02-03 19:26:53+00:00,5.0,0.5293290043290043,-0.0250324675324675,Negative,1,lbvuuf

gr2acyy,From what I understood you can hang out with vaccinated people and children (not eligible for vaccine). Those who are not vaccinated can be asymptomatic carriers. Keep in mind the vaccine itself isn't a shield. Your coverage isn't 100% and can still contract the virus. Your symptoms won't be as bad and the odds of landing in the hospital are slim. I still wouldn't risk it. How did you get vaccinated if you were pregnant?,Kidlike101,2021-03-15 22:43:33+00:00,,0.5833333333333333,-0.1833333333333332,Negative,m5rnad,m5rnad
gnt39xk,-First hand-I will only tell you some things I have seen. I work in a nursing home my patients received the second dose of the vaccine approximately two weeks ago. Since the second dose was administered three patients have died(all but one of the patients were projected to have greater than 6 months to live the other was likely to be taken off hospice as they were showing no signs of decline) a fourth had a TIA days after having the vaccine and is active dying now. At least four other patients are as of Sunday showing signs of significant decline. This home has &lt; 40 patients-Second hand from a reliable source-Nurses have been ordered to wait two weeks after the second dose is administered to give TB tests as the body often mounts no immune response to tuberculosis for a time after the vaccine is received. Those who receive the vaccine are now told to postpone any upcoming mammograms as the lymph nodes under the armpits swell so severely it appears to be breast cancer.,maybe-dissenting,2021-02-17 20:57:31+00:00,,0.4372222222222222,0.0118686868686868,Positive,lm22r8,lm22r8

gqz4sky,So about 12 hours in i ran a low grade fever. Took two Tylenol pm and went to bed. Had a weird dream but not put of the norm for me. When I woke up my body was so stiff it felt like it was made out of wood like all my joints were locked up but it passed. Nothing a little biofreeze and Tylenol couldn't fix. I felt fine today. I took my kids to the park and we all took a long nap. I felt great when I woke up...actually better than I have all week. I did take some zyrtec today because the pollen is awful here in Georgia everything is covered in yellow. I will give another update as time goes on to see how it affects my post covid vertigo and fatigue The long haul vertigo and fatigue has been almost debilitating for me to work full time as an in person teacher. Hoping it improves as I don't want to stay on vertigo meds long term. The vaccine mostly made me super hungry like I was on steroids. Now the crohns part: I had some watery mucous stools but not painful or cramping. I frequently felt like I had to go to the bathroom but every time I went then I didn't have to go. I have been chugging water all day I got at least 65 oz down.

I've been consulting with our medical directors regularly as more information comes out and they have recommended that any staff with a history of severe vaccine reactions not get it until more is known. I had already planned to not get it but I will reconsider  once a larger roll out is done and more data is released. The mRNA vaccines will not have the same ingredients that were used in the PPV23 but the others using traditional vaccine methods probably will have some of the same.

gmmdnyq,Hi! So this ( was my post re: vaccine  1 that I got on Saturday (020621). I also have ADHD and also PTSD with generalized anxiety disorder. So I can big time relate. I am now a little over 72 hours post vaccine. Arm hurt more on Sunday (akin to a horse kick vs a 12 year old’s punch). A little more tiredbrain foggy than usual - I would liken it to how I feel if I don’t take my meds that day. I iced my deltoid off and on throughout the weekend and took a few hot showers to relax the muscle before doing some gentle stretches. A little sore today but barely noticeable at this point.I did take my ADHD meds per usual before my vaccine largely because without them my executive functioning is shit. And I hadStuff to do before my 3:20 appointment. After my shot I did feel more flushed in the face than usual and it did ramp up my anxiety. But my heart rate stayed level with controlled and practiced breathing exercises. If anything the lethargy and brain fog I felt afterwards seemed to negate my ADHD meds. Anxiety was likely higher though because of the meds. I’m so excited for you! Congrats on the vaccine- you’ll do great. tl;dr: ADHD meds did not cause tachycardia from an interaction with the injection. Meds did cause more of an awareness of my flushed face and anxiety around the vaccine because that’s what the meds do - they increase my focus and bodily awareness. If you can function and take a day or two off the meds go for it. ADHD meds can increase anxiety and awareness of anxiety but the shot did not cause actual negative interactions with meds. Medics should be on hand; if you feel the panic set in have them check your vitals. Sometimes just seeing a number can kick panic in the ass.,SunnyPOS,2021-02-08 20:41:48+00:00,,0.4491428571428571,0.0928214285714285,Positive,lfky5h,lfky5h

Saturday 13021 I worked out really hard yoga weights pickleball and around 8 pm started feeling fatigue. Still feeling fatigue this Wedn 2321 sorta like when I fight the flu or cold. On Sunday I got a PCR test which today was told is negative. Back early March from a dentist visit I probably got covid and had long haul issues for 4 months. I don't leave my yard and only had a neighbor outside back in July and we kept approximately 25 feet; no other visitors. Other than my husband who does pickup of groceries to car trunk every 2 weeks we don't do anything else nor leave our yard so if I got covid it would have been during the vaccine. Two workers were taking their mask off in the hallway and it was a crowded space plus they allowed an old guy to come in with a vented mask. Am worried about the second vaccine but will do it.

I'm trying to draw a correlation between the MRNA Covid vaccines and older science that created the Synagis RSV (Respitory Syncyial Virus) shot that has been around for over 20 years.  The Synagis RSV shot was (is) an expensive shot given to my knowledge very young at risk children to protect them from the virus that could have potentially fatal outcome.  My child was an at risk case which it was deemed medically necessary for her to have this (weeks and months of arguing with insurance to provide it).  My child has suffered no known effects from having this synthetic drug which the science parallels MRNA vaccines and is currently being developed now under the exact same process as the MRNA vaccines.  I'm posting this here because I find it fascinating and infuriating of all the groups and the questions about the vaccines and which type and use on kids that so many are against them because they are ""new"" no one knows the long term outcomes... yada yada.. and yet there is very much scientific research out there to counter that it's just not in a nice tight ball of info somewhere.  If anyone has the ""brain"" to look further into this... I would appreciate it while I think it would be great to counter some of the social media arguments we come across I need this to convince my husband that our daughter who has technically already received a similar medicine to the MRNA vaccine would benefit greatly from it and not be being put in ""harms"" way because she already has been exposed to it and at a very young age and very low weight.

got5e93,It’s hard to tell. I was fully aware of where I was and it felt like I was sinking deeper into my couch and was having trouble breathing. I wanted to sit up so badly and drink water but I couldn’t move thus came the panic feeling. I felt even more panicked because I was remembering that I just got the vaccine and was afraid it was doing something to me. I also felt like I was about to faint in my dream ( I have had fainting spells in the past and it felt very similar to blacking out) I wanted to call out for help and couldn’t and remember vividly thinking I need to wake up or snap out of it. Finally I woke up. So I was right on the brink of awakening and was having very vivid and realistic thoughts that I can remember but I wasn’t actually awake. Also I should mention that like you I was kind of waking up throughout my nap from little things such as a tv being on in the other room. So it wasn’t a super deep sleep. Just very confused. Waking up around 2:30 is the worst lol I always think it’s a break in *Disclaimer* - I am not questioning the vaccine at all.  I am very trusting in science and am happy that I got it!

gsu4hqo,"&gt;Right but no one knows the long term effects of mRNA vaccines. This is new technology. Only been studied for a total of 5 years and this is the first ever mRNA vaccine to be made. I’d say it’s a valid question. I’m also concerned about autoimmune diseases.No it's not a ""valid question."" Your reasoning follows this structure:Premise 1: Genetics plus something else causes autism.Premise 2: No one knows the long term effects of mRNA vaccines._________________________________________________________________________Conclusion: There is a possibility that taking an mRNA vaccine will unlock the autism gene in my next pregnancy.This is not logic. This is not even remotely rational. The mRNA vaccine tells your immune system how to make the Covid-19 protein spike. It has nothing to do with autism. Look I understand that autism is a terrible thing and nobody wants their child to have to go through that if it can be avoided and you're worried about it happening again. You didn't do anything to cause the first case of autism in your children. There is no good reason to think your next child will have autism and absolutely no reason to think that taking this vaccine - which you badly need - will cause your next pregnancy to result in a second autistic child. You should get the vaccine and have as many children as you want.",mapletreesnsyrup,2021-03-30 19:48:11+00:00,,0.4125199362041467,-0.0638755980861243,Negative,gsr28n2,mfuxbt

m5fciu,Moderna vaccine first dose Here's my timeline so far:*  12 March: Received my first dose last Friday no issues at the time. Later in the day I noticed my arm was a little sore just like after a flu shot. I'm normally a night owl and was surprised when I was dead tired by 9:30pm and went to bed at 10pm.*  13 March: Slept until 7am woke up to use the bathroom then went back to bed until 11am. Definitely felt a bit lethargic throughout the day. My Alarm was extremely sore all day and taking ibuprofen had no noticeable effect.* 14 March: Arm stopped hurting around noon but noticed my lower back was aching a little bit. Lethargy even worse.* 15 March (today): Woke up today and felt like I had been hit by a truck. My lower back and my calves are aching like crazy and I have no energy to speak of.1010 would get vaccinated again.

However my second dose only really gave me fatigue in which I slept many hours. I am not trying to complain about not having many side effects (I am very sorry for those who have). I think it sometimes makes me wonder if I was given the vaccine correctly? I also expected worse symptoms due to having COVID in October. I also haven’t heard of anyone that I know who has had a milder ride with the second dose.

I’m immunosuppressed and have to see many people face to face with my job in health care for at least an hour at a time. I always take the flu and pneumonia vaccine because without the vaccine I may die from either. I’m not the healthiest person and tend to get sick often at work-pre-Covid (I’ve been fortunate to do Telehealth since Covid). I have a progressive liver disease that is currently stable and would like it to stay that way. I don’t want Covid because I worry it will kill me or progress my stable disease and have that kill me.

gep1quu,"&gt; As I said there is no evidence COVID vaccines stop people becoming infected clearly you’re another person who has not a clue that an upper respiratory tract infection that is what COVID 19 is can be cured and it can’t.LOL you're an idiot and you don't even understand why.Vaccines prevent people from getting the disease. That's the whole point. When data is presented that they're 95% effective it means that at least 95% of the vaccinated people won't get the disease. 95% won't get the infection even. Out of the rest only a minority will get the disease.This is not about curing the disease and nobody ever said it was.Also COVID-19 is not an infection nor is it an upper respiratory tract infection. You better google that term to see what it ACTUALLY means before you make an even bigger idiot out of yourself (hard to imagine how but you'll probably manage).&gt; Put into simple terms how are you stopping the virus entering your respiratory tract?It's not about that. We get tons of stuff in our respiratory tract but it doesn't affect us.&gt; the vaccine didn’t stop you becoming infected it just helped you fight of the infection.Again you're using words but you have no clue what they mean.* *To invade and proliferate in often resulting in disease. Used of microorganisms or other infectious agents.*And if you don't know what ""proliferate"" means:* *To grow or multiply by rapidly producing new tissue parts cells or offspring.*That's exactly what the trained adaptive immune system prevents. And that's EXACTLY how vaccines work.&gt; Moreover that is not guaranteed for all individualsIt never is and it doesn't have to be. Reducing chance of infection severely reduces the overall spread rate (the R factor). With enough people vaccinated the R factor goes waaay below 1 making the number of new cases become smaller by each passing day.&gt; if you’d like to share your data that proved vaccinated individuals can’t shed virusThat's literally how vaccines work you dumbo. They prevent infection. Only infected individuals can shed virus because otherwise there is no virus to shed. [The claim by vaccine manufacturers]( that is being checked RIGHT NOW by regulartory bodies in many governments is that the vaccine prevents infection and that you're talking complete bullshit out of your ass.&gt; I’m sure once you wrap your head around these facts you see the light.What facts?

[ *Our review of the literature offers evidence in favor of widespread mask use as source control to reduce community transmission: Nonmedical masks use materials that obstruct particles of the necessary size; people are most infectious in the initial period postinfection where it is common to have few or no symptoms (*[***45***]( ref-45)** [***46***]( ref-46)** [***141***]( ref-141)*); nonmedical masks have been effective in reducing transmission of respiratory viruses; and places and time periods where mask usage is required or widespread have shown substantially lower community transmission.**The available evidence suggests that near-universal adoption of nonmedical masks when out in public in combination with complementary public health measures could successfully reduce ReRe to below 1 thereby reducing community spread if such measures are sustained.

ky45ly,VaccinePre-Pregnancy Hey guys- this might have already been asked or answered- sorry! I am in vaccine group 1B as an essential worker- I am 29 very healthy and looking to get pregnant in about the next 2 years. Let me be clear- I am NOT vaccine skeptical not sure if skeptical is even the right word here....I just have some anxiety because the vaccine has been produced very quickly with some safety measures potentially rushed due to the nature of the emergency. I get that. I also have done some very minor research about the mRNA process that this vaccine utilizes which makes me feel more comfortable that it isn’t necessarily live virus. I just have some questions. All of my coworkers with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 have their sleeves rolled up and ready to go- but I’m questioning some things because I want to make sure there are no long term effects of these vaccines that could be reproductively dangerous? The more I type this the crazier I feel like I sound 🙃 anybody have any credible research or reading that pertains to this? I fully understand the need for this vaccine and why it’s important I just don’t know that it is right for me at this moment and I feel like things have been very unnecessarily politicized so it’s clouding my judgement.

gl87bbq,I agree I'm a psychologist that fortunately have been able to telework through all this. I also have a few underlying health conditions (at least three) that put me at a possible high risk of having a bad outcome to COVID. Since I've been able to telework I did not sign up for 1a but signed up for 1c (due to my health risk)-which I think is now 1b. However after seeing SO many people who are not in the field healthy and extremely loosely connected to healthcare (as in they work for a non-profit or consulting or something where they would never be in contact with anyone outside of their coworkers anyway but have been remote this whole time) jump the line. My husband works for the government and is able to get the vaccine before me. He's a programmer and works 100% at home. If I did not make the executive decision to move to 100% telework 2 weeks before my state locked down I absolutely would have gotten it and spread it-especially since my office reopened and has had at least three separate full on break outs of COVID since March. It's so gross. First on the list should have been hospital employees and healthcare workers that are in the hospital regularly in addition to all people who have health issues AND have high risk of exposure by having to be out due to their job. PLUS the reality that I have had to cancel a few medical appointments as I'm not yet vaccinated and there is a more contagious strain out there.

gqarfp9,1. Let's start with the definition of a Serious Adverse Event. As noted on the Health Canada Website.An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization. It isn’t necessarily causally related to the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any:* unfavourable or unintended sign (for example: skin rash)* abnormal laboratory finding* symptom or* diseasePlease see Fig. 4. for a breakdown of these events. [Most frequently reported adverse events up to and including February 26 2021 (n=4341)](A total of nine reports identified deaths that occurred after the administration of a vaccine. Following medical case review it has been determined that seven of these deaths are not linked to a COVID-19 vaccine and the other two are still under investigation.Basically adverse events are not something to be concerned about. The most serious one is Anaphylaxis and for this there is a recommended 15 minute post-vaccination observation period.  2. There is no evidence to suggest that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines or non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines would result in cytokine storms.Thus far no vaccine producers have found any evidence of ADE or cytokine storm from any trial phase. In addition rates of disease were significantly lower in the vaccinated group and among those who did contract COVID-19 in the vaccinated group rates of severe disease were lower than in the placebo group.Scientists and public health professionals will continue to closely monitor vaccinated individuals to ensure that ADE and cytokine storms can be entirely ruled out as a side effect of COVID-19 vaccines. For the moment however there is no evidence that shows the vaccines to have such effects.  3. Boosters are already in the works. [ - this said it is unknown how frequently they will be needed.  4. When it comes to the long-term consequences of vaccines it's important to note that unlike many drugs which are taken at regular intervals for long periods of time vaccines are only administered at infrequent intervals and only once or twice for a given vaccine.This is why many drugs need to be tested for years to establish side effect profiles; the consistent concentrations of the drugs over a long period of time can cause harm which can present years after first starting the medication. Vaccines on the other hand are rapidly cleared meaning that they do not stay in the body for long periods of time and are thus highly unlikely to cause issues that present after more than a few weeks.In addition to monitor for any safety events that may occur we have a long-standing robust vaccine safety monitoring system that has been operating for decades. We also have multiple tracking systems in place in the extremely unlikely event that problems caused by the vaccine occur in any significant numbers it will be detected quickly.5. Please consult your family doctor for advice on how to proceed. Reddit is not a good place to seek out medical advice. 6. Yes. The goal is to return to normal.,adotmatrix,2021-03-09 05:31:22+00:00,,0.4484943351222421,0.0437984496124031,Positive,m0ydsy,m0ydsy

gnwme66,When you are vaccinated your body is made to believe you've been infected with the virus.  Everything you described except the racing heart is absolutely the typical reaction of someone's immune system to this virus.  Racing heart rate is a less typical but not super uncommon reaction.  I'm glad they determined that's what it was and not something more serious (like an allergic reaction).As far as not wanting it to happen again I can understand that.  It was obviously very frightening.  But consider that if THAT is the reaction a fake virus causes you what would your reaction be to an actual infection where the virus keeps replicating in a way the fake one doesn't so that more or more of it would be present prompting more and more symptoms like that lasting for weeks instead of a few hours?  That's what the vaccine saves you from and that's why it would be worth getting a second dose to make sure you don't have to face the impact of the real virus.Of course you should take whatever advice your doctor has for you about that instead of that of internet strangers though.,Reneeisme,2021-02-18 17:19:32+00:00,,0.5315555555555556,0.09,Positive,gnwkono,lmnm4l

gsx2dvk,Ok good you're still asking questions. It's good to keep an open mind especially on such an important subject. I have answers for you.The first thing to mention is that adverse reactions are ridiculously unreported. A study puts the people that record their adverse effects at 1% of the actual figure. Most people have no clue what VAERS is and that is not by accident.The second thing to say is that this is not over in terms of what the vaccines are going to do to people. There are no medium or long term studies and the good experts I hear talking about this vaccine have investigated it and found that there are several ways which it can do serious harm sometime in short term and the future.Finally operation Covid has to be seen in it's totality. There are the deaths caused by the laboratory modified pathogen they unleashed (exaggerated numbers but it did kill people) the horrific amount of deaths from lockdowns which far outnumber the actual deaths from Covid and finally the vaccines which are going to be taking people out for years. There has already been a culling and it's not news to me as these psychopaths have been talking about reducing the number of people in the world for years. It's what the fake man made climate change is also an excuse for them to do.,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-31 14:30:23+00:00,,0.5659722222222222,0.0381944444444444,Positive,gsvtm91,men1ml

gsqphwf,Not trying to say vaccines are bad. I asked for information to make sure there wasn’t a known solution that I was missing to help my father. For further reference: Sometimes the immune response is what can cause damage or lasting affects as opposed to the virus itself. It is important to understand how a persons immune system will react to stimulation so that you can avoid lasting damage. I have a genetic disease that affects my immune system amongst other systems and have learned a lot from my immunologist. It wouldn’t be good for me to get Covid 19 and my body would crash if the vaccine triggered a fever or increased heart rate. My father had no known issues with vaccines prior to this. He’s kept up with all and has never had a reaction. He would never say it’s a bad decision to get it. I’m sure he hopes he gets his vision back though. Medicine isn’t perfect and there are always exceptions.

These groups include all adult ages not just 65+. Do we require people to carry around a vaccine card and companies can ask for proof before doing business with them?I want everything to be open 100% but I am not sure how we do that yet and only allow determine who is vaccinated and not unless we use the honor system.

Any time I've ever posted online about a medication side effect it's been to compare notes with other people and look for support.  For example loads of doctors will CLAIM that IUDs don't cause weight gain but my experience is that they always cause me to gain weight and not be able to drop it and I get further with making decisions by talking to other women online and comparing first hand experiences than I do just talking to a doctor.  It's a free fucking country and free fucking internet world we need to be able to compare notes.

gnawoos,I just unfriended an aunt and neighbor who told me to stop overreacting when I mentioned the side effects from the first Moderna which I had all of. One was in the army and I think got the Pfizer one mentioned how he had no side effects and said I was making it sound like the worst thing in the world.   This was on Inauguration Day so part of it I think was because I supported the new president. I think for one it also was envy most of the public can't get it yet. My mother kept texting me for three days after I got it asking how I felt when she found out I got it. I didn't tell her so it's clear someone behind my back did. After I ignored her for three days she called me on a Sunday night basically thinking I was dead. I yelled at her over the phone for it for being paranoid and listening to the news too much.I get the second one on Friday and will telling yelling absolutely no one until it's in effect.,Braden675,2021-02-13 22:09:52+00:00,,0.4281565656565657,-0.0261363636363636,Negative,liga63,liga63

They are absolutely relentless whenever you deviate from what they think you should be doing literally never ever giving up until you tell them they were right and act accordingly.

I get that vaccin production take time and is limited by production capacity. My question is : if both vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are accepted by the FDA that would mean they are 2 existing vaccin that are approuve for use safely (probably more in other country but I dont follow that topic much). So would it be possible for thoses two business to give the vaccin ""recipe"" to other worldwide pharmaceutical laboratories so other country could start production for their own citizens ?

I am saying that there are people who need that vaccine and that his argument that he deserves it because he will be going to work soon and risking his life isn’t a good argument for taking it from someone who is at increased risk. Many employees were deemed essential. He wasn’t obviously deemed essential because he is just now returning to work after probably working from home. That isn’t an argument of one life over another.

m29ker,Anyone done one shot Pfizer then J&amp;J? I had the first shot Pfizer on 28 Feb and experienced what felt like an allergic reaction at the time but in retrospect I was less sure. My allergist wrote “Patient reaction occurred within 5 minutes that may be consistent with anxiety reaction vs allergic reaction: rapid heart rate shivers tight chest and throat. No change in vital signs in fact her heart rate and blood pressure where elevated. No wheezing no emesis no hives. We agreed it would be fine to take second shot with epi at the ready. Now she wrote me that since CDC guidance has changed I should probably get Johnson and Johnson instead of second Pfizer shot. I really don’t mind but it strikes me that far fewer people have done that and as such it feels riskier. I have send a few questions back to her but if any of you have had similar experiences then I’d love to know.

gf5n1ka,Any rational person would inform themselves first before taking an experimental vaccine where zero data has been published. I read an article in the British Medical Journal where professors were saying they had concerns that the vaccine has not been peer reviewed and it is unheard of for no data to be published about the clinical trials before a vaccine is rolled out to the public. Fact is Pfizer don’t know if the vaccine is effective how long it is effective for and what the potential side effects are. As far as I can see this is a huge PR campaign with little concern for the general public. On another note Pfizer have a terrible reputation with lawsuits coming out of their ears. The fact that the British government have put in a clause to say that Pfizer are not accountable for anything that might go wrong and that they have capped compensation claims at £120000 is a huge red flag for me. I think you’re totally right to be cautious completely inform yourself and do the research before you make any decision!,Slight-Fisherman-762,2020-12-09 10:46:00+00:00,,0.5001133786848073,0.0558673469387755,Positive,k81tsn,k81tsn

gibkn7b,MicroRNA manipulating your body to produce and attack a protein is very dangerous. First we do not know what long term effects this has and it has been attempted in the past with SARS etc and never have they been able to safely make it work. Suddenly billions of dollars are on the table and they say ahh its fine!The reality is the protein that the vaccine teaches your immune system to attack exists in your body already naturally. When a woman gets pregnant for example it is a critical step in the egg bonding with the uterus. We have no data on people getting pregnant and having kids after receiving both doses of the vaccine. Currently we know very little about how the vaccine affects the overall population due to the fact that the millions of people who have gotten it only have gotten their first dose which is not nearly as effective as the second dose.  Surely we dont have any studies on bringing a child to full term after receiving both doses because the vaccines havn't even existed long enough to see how it might impact such a thing.Another point is the DNA manipulation you experience will get passed right down to the kids. We don't know if it will cause severe autoimmune disorders like they saw in Ferrets with the same style of vaccine. So while a man may feel safer to take it than a woman if he has a daughter who knows what happens to her?The vaccines were fast tracked and they are experimental. It has never successfully been done before. The laws gave legal leeway for this to happen because Trump wants to reopen the economy. In the elderly which are the highest risk group the vaccine is probably much safer for them as side effects from DNA manipulation take years to reveal themselves and they don't have a lot of years left anyway nor will they be having children. For young healthy individuals the death rate from covid is much much lower and as a frontline worker you may feel that it is in your best interest to get it. However you will be working for weeks unprotected as you await the second dose timeline and youve already been working unassisted for months anyway most likely.The safest thing you can do is supplement Vitamin D which has been shown to be very effective at fightingpreventing the virus. If you are taking the vaccine to protect your patients assuredly you shouldn't bother as they have said it does not prevent you from being a carrier. In fact it will limit the symptoms if it works as intended and therefor make it more dangerous because you are less likely to be aware that you are a carrier.Triggering cells to produce proteins may sound safe but cells share information with each other and things like Lewy Body Dementia which Robin Williams suffered from and it made him suicidal and depressed are from proteins growing where they were not intended.Anyone saying this vaccine is 100% safe is 100% lying because there has not possibly been enough time to determine that.Another detail here is that with the Virus mutating at it's current rate they will likely not be effective within the next few months anyway. The last mutation has 18 changes which is the most ever observed in a natural setting likely pointing to the virus being made in a lab but that's unconfirmable at this time. If the vaccines protect from this mutation which it is not confirmed if they do or not that protection likely wont apply 3 or 4 mutations down the road.Not that they know how long the vaccines benefits last for as again they havnt been around but a few months so no way to test such a thing.It is a giant experiment with a low upside and huge risk. I would not recommend it.,mathcebo,2021-01-06 17:11:20+00:00,,0.4833668678739101,0.1000824390789179,Positive,krq4na,krq4na

glpn0rj,Why are people taking this vaccine?!? Sure you might think you’re doing a positive for society but your risking your own health. This shit is NOT proven safe NOT effective. People have developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome Bell’s palsy and other serious conditions. Some have gone blind or deaf or died. Along with that many pregnant women have had miscarriages dude to receiving the vaccine. There’s evidence that may suggest that the vaccine harms reproductive organs. Bill gates sterilized thousands in Africa with vaccines and I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s doing it again. If you’re healthy and young you have to be stupid to receive the vaccine. Covid poses virtually no threat to the vast majority of most healthy people. Why would you risk your own wellbeing for a vaccine that is not safe and doesn’t prevent you from contracting Covid???,54box3S54,2021-02-02 09:15:08+00:00,,0.6591750841750842,0.1215367965367965,Positive,lack8z,lack8z

gsqaqt2,Weakness is a serious symptom if it persists.  The side effect that paused the AZ vaccine trial was a case of transverse myelitis which is an inflammatory reaction in a localized region of the spinal cord.  A typical symptom is limb weakness and possibly sensory symptoms most commonly symmetric and determined by the height of the region in the spinal cord.  It has been attributed as a side effect to vaccines in the past (like GBS) so not inplausible that it could occur rarely with these vaccines.,ArizonaRocks,2021-03-29 21:01:33+00:00,,0.6166666666666666,-0.0357142857142857,Negative,mfhkqv,mfhkqv

I got my first shot (Pfizer) on Friday afternoon 312 around 315 and have been having side effects (i think?) since. My arm was initially really sore to the point where it hurt to move similar to working out but now that is gone and fully went away on Sunday night. However within the last 24 hours I’ve started to feel super tired and groggy but I don’t have a fever. This started on Sunday (314) and I’m curious is this the vaccine doing its job and settling in? Idk why it’s happening nearly two full days after. Over the course of the weekend I felt like something was creeping up but now it’s in full force.

l8gt5d,Dear people please take care of yourselves post-vaccine. I’m shocked that more employers aren’t more proactive in allowing for flexibilitytime off post vaccine. Your well-being MATTERS don’t allow yourself to get manipulated into doing more activity than you are comfortable performing! Let me make this perfectly clear before I ramble on: I am the side effect QUEEN. It took me nearly 5 years to find migraine meds that worked for me without upending my life in some other way. My experience has been worse than everyone I personally know. I also am of the belief that everyone who CAN get the vaccine SHOULD and any the typical side effects are still better than COVID any day.That said- I can’t tell you how glad I am that I was able to schedule my shot for when I would not be working the next day. My first jab was Jan 2 on a Saturday so I had that night and Sunday to recover from mild symptoms. I had a temp of about 99.8 at highest some chills and fatigue. I got the second Jan earlier today on a Friday expecting I might need even more time off after hearing it can be worse. Spoiler alert: for me it has been much worse. I just woke up in the middle of the night with a 100.5 fever chills so bad I was shaking and every muscle in my body hurts mostly from bracing against the chills (some vomiting for what seems to be the same reason). An hour ago I couldn’t have even typed this. I just showered took more ibuprofen pedialight some Tums to curb the post-vomit reflux and vitamin C cough drops. Feeling much better now wearing more layers in front of my apartment heater. I’m admittedly anxious from how terrible this is but trusting that everything is gonna be okay as long as I can keep babying myself. You know what would SUCK? If I was expected to work tomorrow. I would absolutely have to call out which I often find makes things even more stressful worrying about my job. My partner was completely fine the next day after his shot but would it have been the worst thing in the world if he had given himself time just in case?Many cultures and career fields make us feel like we can never take off work unless we absolutely have to. Friend this is a great time to advocate for yourself and at the very least plan for some flexibility if you’re going to need it. Do research and gather up supplies that could help you feel better if needed. See if you can draw on any household supports to give you a break. Give space and understanding for yourself to feel anxious about the unknowns. Don’t lie about how you’re feeling in attempt not to scare others. The truth might be that you have absolutely no reaction or you might feel crappy for a little while and we need to acknowledge that is a possibility. Again if this is my reaction to the vaccine I cannot imagine how absolutely miserable and terrifying having COVID would be. Take care of yourselves and your loved ones ❤️,stanky-hanky-panky,2021-01-30 07:45:51+00:00,25.0,0.564863945578231,0.0485884353741496,Positive,1,l8gt5d

In this case the world has been split into 2 groups of people- those who are sheep and do as they are told with no common sense and those who see this situation for what it is (sinister) and won’t take it. Considering vaccines are too protect yourself I’m not sure why so many of you have your knickers in a twist about those who are happy to trust their immune systems. I mean a virus that has a 99% recovery rate and is so mild you need a test to tell you if you even have it doesn’t really warrant being a science guinea pig?So you continue to pump poison in your bodies... it will be interesting to see what happens in the next 5 years because you won’t be able to sue when you start getting neurological issues and auto immune diseases suddenly surge!,GCSE23,2021-02-14 10:59:00+00:00,,0.5751157407407408,0.1600694444444444,Positive,gnax0s9,lj9iay

m189fg,Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) Vaccine Effects I found these posts super helpful when I was dealing with these side effects last night so I thought I’d post here too.I (26F) received the J&amp;J vaccine yesterday at 1:30pm. Around 6:00pm I started having a headache and body aches. By 7:30pm I had a low-grade fever (99.6) body aches chills and no appetite. I took a Tylenol which helped for a few hours. However by 11:00pm I had severe chills body aches a fever (102) and nausea. My fever probably peaked around (103) a few hours later. I finally fell asleep around 4:00am. At 10:00am I’m tired and achy but I feel infinitely better. (Body temp is currently 98.4)To be honest this was definitely the sickest I’ve been in recent memory. However I would absolutely do it again.What really helped: alternating Tylenol and Motrin once the symptoms started; staying hydrated; using cold compresses; and knowing that it would all pass in a few hours. I would definitely recommend getting your vaccine on a Friday or calling out of work the next day; that way you can rest and recover without worrying.,georgemichael1987,2021-03-09 15:05:08+00:00,2.0,0.4379629629629629,0.0129629629629629,Positive,1,m189fg

gie3eu7,First mRNA doesn’t change your DNA. Your body makes mRNA to create all sorts of proteins none of which alter your DNA. [mRNA doesn’t work like that]( nor is DNA capable of manipulation in that way. The instructions provided to your cells by the mRNA to build the spike protein from the virus doesn’t change the nature of your cells. This also means the mRNA from the vaccine is not inheritable. Second mRNA degrades after translation in 3 to 8 minutes. This means after your cells read the mRNA it starts to breakdown so it doesn’t linger in your body. The point of mRNA is to be a blueprint for your cells to build all kinds of proteins needed for your body to function. In the case of the vaccine that mRNA teaches your cells how to build an inert part of the COVID-19 virus. Your cells follow these instructions which then triggers your immune system because it rightly recognizes these new proteins as foreign. Your body then creates antibodies to this spike protein but without the virus itself so it’s a relatively consequence free and efficient way to gain immunity without actual exposure. Third it’s true the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus and the protein the mRNA teaches your cells to make share a very short sequence of amino acids with a placental protein. This is not consequential because the sequence on the spike protein is shorter than the placental protein. This is key because antibodies don’t work like shotgun blasts destroying anything and everything in their path. They’re highly specific and directional so the idea that your antibody to the covid-19 spike protein will somehow cause infertility isn’t supported by science and is pure junk. The immune system simply doesn’t work that way.Finally you should get the vaccine. No vaccine in the world works as a suit of armor preventing a virus from invading your body. Vaccines simply provide your body the knowledge to defeat a virus should it ever invade. It’s unclear right now exactly how effective the covid vaccine is in preventing transmission. However it is clear that it is 95% effective in helping you withstand a covid-19 invasion. And remember the outcomes with covid aren’t binary. Living or dying from covid are not the only possible outcomes should you contract the virus. There are a lot of lingering perhaps permanent consequences people experience long after the virus is no longer detectable.Do yourself and your loved ones a favor and get the vaccine.,NotQuiteStableGenius,2021-01-07 04:34:02+00:00,,0.4480343113676447,0.148039923039923,Positive,gibkn7b,krq4na

giqh9pc,Two things. One the vaccine doesn't cause an immune response to all ACE2 receptors which would have horrific effects on everything from blood pressure regulation to kidney function. Instead the vaccine causes a response to the virus protein that binds to ACE2 (note that this is different from what our bodies use to signal at ACE2 too).Two getting COVID will produce an immune response to all the same things the vaccine would and maybe more. We already have strong evidence that COVID-19 confers cognitive deficits but we don't have any evidence that the vaccine impairs cognition. It makes more sense to get the vaccine than to risk COVID if all you're worried about is a cognitive effect.,meta-cognizant,2021-01-10 05:07:44+00:00,,0.576388888888889,0.0722222222222222,Positive,kqieo5,kqieo5

kx9cga,Side effects 3 weeks later? Hi all! My husband got his first dose of Moderna on 1221. He only had a sore arm immediately afterward. Came down with fever headache and stiff neck on 110. Tested negative for Covid (PCR) on 112 and he’s been improving since —he is fever-free today. Everyone else in our house — me 2 year old and 4 month old — are still healthy.I know it could be the flu or another virus but he’s been wearing an n95 to work and had very little exposure over the past few weeks comparatively (he worked one day last week). Flu numbers are also very low here. Just wondering if anyone has had a reaction so long after the shot — or if anyone has any insight from a scientific perspective.

m2sp0c,Second dose questions I just got my vaccine at Walgreens and it was Pfizer so I have to wait 21 days until my next dose but they scheduled me 28 days later which I think is the waiting period for Moderna. Id rather get it earlier than later so is there a way I would be able to push it up or am I supposed to do 28 days?Also if I am not going to be in town the date that I am supposed to get my second dose is it possible for me to schedule it at another location and how would I do that? It seems like its fully booked everywhere so Im not sure how to even make the appointment,kiklo78876,2021-03-11 15:25:09+00:00,2.0,0.3348765432098765,0.0277777777777777,Positive,1,m2sp0c

kv8s15,Advice on vaccinating at risk dad Hi allI know this is a bit of a weird question but we are a bit desperate and looking for advice anywhere we can get it.My mother is currently undergoing a stem cell transplant in a hospital in Boston. She contracted COVID from a nurse and tested positive on her 6th day in the hospital. We are terrified for her well-being as this is the first case like this that the hospital has seen. I am trying to remain positive which of course is very hard. Her oncologist told us that it is very likely she will continue testing positive for COVID for months to come when she is discharged as is common with cancer patients likely at a similar viral load.My father is 68 and has several comorbidities COPD and heart issues (he had a heart attack last year.) I care for both of them and have no siblings or other family that can help. Given that my mom will likely be contagious for months it feels so important to get my father vaccinated but we have made no headway figuring out how. I hear about stories of people getting it through friends in the right places or from leftover doses at distribution centers but we don't know anyone in those places. I have called every hospital several state offices my representatives etc etc. Does anyone have any advice?,iros,2021-01-11 18:34:34+00:00,7.0,0.576381294144452,-0.0150860104807473,Negative,1,kv8s15

n1hwze,Forced Covid Vaccination So here are some interesting observations I thought about before getting the vaccine. The board members of Pfizer haven't received there own vaccine HMMM I still have to wear a mask and socially distance after getting the vaccine HMMM. I am being socially pressured and required by work to get a vaccine HMMM I guess i don't like being forced to do things like take an experimental drug that is not FDA approved. So I went to the DARK WEB and downloaded the vaccine card and measured and got the proper card stock and researched the vial numbers etc. Now work and my family are happy. Best of all that selfie of me with my card. I have a real big smile.,Artistic_Mix8477,2021-04-30 00:06:22+00:00,9.0,0.3448717948717948,0.2012820512820512,Positive,1,n1hwze

mepbie,Questions - Vaccines Efficacies and Updates Since Trials? Posted this in a different covid sub and didn't get any answers. Hoping I have better luck here. thanks in advance...In US so thinking mostly about Moderna Pfizer and J&amp;J but this likely applies more broadly as wellResults of trials were that while rare some vaccinated subjects were infected with Covid-19; however zero of vaccinated subjects had sever symptoms we're hospitalized or died.Two questions:1) How are severe symptoms defined? For example early in the pandemic non-severe seemed to include anything which didn't require hospitalization but could include fatigue significant respiratory difficulty losing taste and smell. Is anything which didn't require medical attention non-severe? What technically requires hospitalization-- seems like that could be broad as well? Basically how badmild is sickness after vaccination when it occurs...2) Are there any significant statistical differences in any data on the general population since we began vaccinating or do similar results hold true-- that vaccinated individuals essentially zero incidences of sever symptoms or death?Links to relevant data appreciated but I am writing this question after reviewing Moderna results and still feeling uncertain on first question above.Thanks again.,oopsbilldoggett,2021-03-27 23:22:55+00:00,10.0,0.4837301587301588,0.2011904761904761,Positive,1,mepbie

gqj7m9p,I would suggest moderna simply because the efficacy is higher than Johnson and Johnson.Johnson and Johnson is using an adenovirus as a vector and you are right they have used that in vaccines before however because adenovirus causes the common cold and there are many serotypes of it you may have seen it before at some point in your life and your prior immunity may dampen the immunogenicity of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine (basically the vaccine won’t be as effective). There was an adenovirus vaccine that was made by Merck about a decade ago that was for HIV they used the adenovirus5 vector (covid one uses adenovirus 27) and they found that the individuals who received the hiv ad5 vaccine had a greater possibility of getting hiv. I skimmed the article today on that specific vaccine so I don’t know the detailed details but some physicians are worried that might happen again with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

gjdmwar,The spike protein isn't native to he human body it's something part of the virus toolkit of invading human bodies.Imagine that you're the virus. The spike protein is a fence cutter(for wire fences) but you mostly run around and find steel barriers or wooden palisades. The wire fences are the specific receptors that you can invade with your wire fence cutters. (human ACE2)The human immune system will chop you to pieces when it finds you and present the fragments of you as evidence to a court(the immune system). The court releases wanted posters for the fragments of you including the fence cutting tool. So when your friends show up with fence cutting tools they get giant wheel locks(antibodies) clamped to their tools and can no longer cut fences with them thus being unable to invade anything anymore.,vivehelpme,2021-01-15 20:02:11+00:00,,0.3604166666666666,-0.0999999999999999,Negative,ky27bk,ky27bk

lq6lqh,volunteer EMT worried about getting 2nd dose Due for my 2nd Moderna dose tomorrow and worried about having a weird auto-immune response to it. After the 1st dose I had arm soreness and felt pretty sick for about 12 hours but then I was fine until a few days later I noticed these weird painful blisterssores that showed up all at once on my hands. They still haven't gone away after 4 weeks and I can't find anything online that matches what they look and feel like (they are definitely not normal blisters I'm certain of that. The closest description I could find online was for chilblains which they might actually be.) I'm also having constant IBS symptoms that I've never experienced before. These two things might be totally unrelated but as a totally healthy 28 yr old with no underlying medical issues no medications and no past experiences like this an auto immune reaction to the vaccine is starting to seem plausible. I've had several drug sensitivities in the past including rashes and once anaphylaxis from an antibiotic. Now I've gotten myself all psyched out about getting the 2nd dose.

gss6nvi,Well... it’s a bit of a ‘luck of the draw’ situation unfortunately and it really depends on the level of exposure and your immune system. You’re not really protected much in the first couple days. At the 1 week mark I think I read that you’ll have 50-60% immunity. At 2 weeks you’re at approximately 80%. You’ll stay there until your second shot which will boost you to max immunity. Unless you got the J&amp;J shot then you don’t need the second jab of course.

gk21t9g,Okay  I've developed new symptoms. Intense dizziness feeling like I've got a build up of electricity in my brain almost like I'm being shocked and now I've now begun to have muscle twitching. It's progressed over the past three days so become more constant and intense. My hands will now twitch close my legs will jerk and my arms will move. It was really bad last night as I was trying to lay down and go to sleep and my body kept moving every 30 seconds or so. I'm actually starting to get scared at this point and have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow though it's unlikely they'll do anything. I don't know what to do but if this doesn't resolve in the next week I will not get the 2nd dose. I will wait for the safe tested tech that's coming out in a few months.

gr2nsmi,I was vaccinated last Tuesday and my arm was very sore as expected for a few days. That didn't bother me much though. The mild aches cough and sluggishness are lasting longer than I expected. I don’t want to over or under sell this.  The only time I felt worried was Saturday evening when I was exhausted dizzy and my body tingled. Nothing happened I was fine. Still not quite at 100% today but almost. My partner had worse effects from the 2nd shot as did everyone I know.  I’m in a very low risk category and feel like the days I would be sick from the shots are more than the days I would be sick from Covid. It's a risk I'm willing to take.

ln2g75,Can't get 2nd Moderna scheduled getting strange excuses as to why My dad is eligible for the Covid vaccine and they are available in our state. He received the 1st Moderna vaccine in January out of state. At the time the clinic told him it wasn't a problem for him to take the 2nd dose after he got back to his home state. They also told him he could take the 2nd dose anytime between 6 weeks and 3 months after the 1st dose. He came back to our state tried to schedule an appointment for the 2nd dose and the doctors told him they weren't able to give him the 2nd Moderna he'd have to start over and take the 1st Pfizer which he didn't want to do since he heard on the news you can't mix the vaccines. And now it's 8 weeks after the 1st dose. The 2nd Moderna is available however we can't find a single clinic to give him the 2nd Moderna dose. Several different medical clinics and VA clinics are giving us different information as to why they can't give him his 2nd dose. Excuses range from - each state has their own dosing so they can't dose for him there's no way to prove he got his first one (we have the vaccination card with the batch information he received) or because 6 weeks passed he has to start over.... None of these excuses about why he can't receive the 2nd dose make any sense.

The FDA and other countries have authorized several vaccines which were reviewed by experts so I am confident that the vaccines work.

It may only be marginally helpful since the info is straight from the health dept websites from each state so most of the info is easy to find anyway. However I hope it helps lay out who is currently eligible for the vaccine so you can easily see if you can get it and where to sign up. I am also working on future eligibly so I can update that when states change who can get the vaccine. I've also been doing all this research myself and have become acquainted with many of the state's distribution plans so ask me if you have questions I'll do my best to answer from what I can research. I am by no means an expert just someone with too much time on their hands at the moment.

If it took 10-15 years of testing before we could tell if a car was safe or not and then someone makes a car and release it to the public in the same year after a only a couple months of testing everyone would think that the manufacturer was crazy so why is it different with a vaccine?

geh2qqg,There can't be any evidence for that because this virus has only existed for a year in humans.There are no warning signs of you understand what's on the wall. Patients who mount a myeloid immune response as opposed to adaptive T-cell response are those that suffer the heavy symptoms. Those who mount an immune response from T-cells are more likely to be asymptomatic or with very light symptoms and thus not even diagnosed most of the time.The reports about reinfection often covers these situations:* Heavy symptoms the first time (myeloid response)* Immune system is suppressed (cancer patients)* False negative test that said that they no longer have the virusThere is hardly any evidence that a person with adaptive immune response the first time was ever reinfected. If there are any people they would fit in the area of those 10% if the immune response from the virus is 90% effective meaning that heard immunity would be rock solid considering that many of the vaccines in the 80s had around 70% effectiveness and still managed to wipe out diseases.The vaccines train the adaptive immune system very efficiently.As for the mutations - the mRNA vaccines code for the spike protein the virus uses to infect. If that one mutates then the virus will no longer be able to infect humans. If it doesn't mutate then we'll be immune to it.In theory it's rock solid and nothing should go wrong. In practice it behaves very well on a relatively small sample size.There are no reasons to worry except for some things that are still unknown and demand caution. There are definitely no alarms warranted.,coffeewithalex,2020-12-03 10:19:08+00:00,,0.5268055555555556,0.0907638888888889,Positive,gbwvck2,hb5omo

gqx6grn,All my coworkers and I got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine this past week. My buddy (26) was the first martyr who was fine until about 10 hours later when he got a low grade fever. Then came the chills body aches nausea etc. He was wiped the entire next day. So we experimented with our other coworkers by trying out Tylenol cold &amp; flu severe right before the symptoms were expected to hit. The next one in line (32) got the jab around 3pm and took a dose of this right before bed. He made it out the next morning without any side effects except for tiredness. Finally I (27) got my jab yesterday at 1pm. I didn’t hydrate enough and overexerted myself playing disc golf in the cold so I felt the first onset of symptoms at 6pm. Boy they came up quick! Immediately was the fatigue and shortly thereafter were chills body aches shivering and nausea. I took the Tylenol and it began working quickly eliminating all side effects except for the fatigue. Then around midnight after going to bed I started feeling the body aches again. Sweating and restless but I couldn’t move so I had my brother bring me another dose. Started working pretty quickly and was sound asleep within 30 minutes. Now it’s the next morning and my body is a bit sore but otherwise it’s not bad. Still gonna lay low today but I definitely do not regret the vaccine. If you’re worried about side effects I highly recommend taking this stuff as soon as you start feeling worn down!,littlestepsilon,2021-03-14 18:09:02+00:00,,0.4394550264550264,0.0620661375661375,Positive,m503zf,m503zf

Q Can an RNA vaccine change my DNA?A There are some who claim that ribonucleic acid (RNA) vaccines can manipulate and change human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) resulting in a genetically-modified human.Biologically it just does not work that way. DNA uses one set of molecules for its genetic code while RNA is made up of a different set of molecules.The genetic information flow is one-way: DNA contains information that cells use to make messenger RNA (mRNA) which in turn provides a template to assemble proteins the body needs. The mRNA in Covid-19 vaccines cannot change human DNA. ,kennese2007,2021-03-09 08:26:21+00:00,,0.4097222222222222,0.0958333333333333,Positive,gqb3172,m0rcxf

gsndyp6,There is no real concern about fertility! That rumor was started from a baseless theory that someone who didn’t know what they were talking about posted online. They based it on a few very small overlaps in the sequence of the spike protein and a protein necessary for fertility and theorized that the immune response from the vaccine would also target those proteins. However the sequence alignment was absolute garbage to anyone who actually knows what they’re talking about. They are nowhere near similar enough to actually be affected. Also if this were the case then people who actually had covid would also be at risk for infertility. If you want a more in depth explanation the Instagram account virus.vs.labcoat is a virologist and has an excellent highlight titled “infertility ey?” where she walks through what I’m talking about and shows the sequences! Tl;dr there is no concern about fertility from actual experts and this is a theory promoted by anti-vaxxers to scare people,watermelon_200,2021-03-29 03:14:26+00:00,,0.4299999999999999,0.0821428571428571,Positive,mfbziz,mfbziz

gn3t939,Sorry it had been a while since I checked the stats directly. Surprisingly the deaths in elderly from Covid have spiked in the past 6 weeks since I've checked this last. I wonder if it's related to the vaccine distribution? (RIP Hank Arron)Lets do some math together...[These are the numbers from California.Let's take a look...Ages 1-17 Survival Rate =  |431804 - 13|431804 = 431791431804 = 0.99996989374809 = 99.996989374809% Ages 18-34  Survival Rate = |1129585 - 616|1129585 = 11289691129585 = 0.99945466697947 =  99.945466697947%This is the metric that sticks out in my mind as it applies to the majority of reddit.Survival Rate ages 1-34  = |1561389 - 629|1561389 = 15607601561389 = 0.99959715356007 = 99.959715356007% If you are under 35 you have a 99.96~% chance of survival.As you get older that's where we see increases in death stats....Ages 35-49 Survival Rate = |806234 - 2405|806234 = 803829806234 = 0.99701699506595 = 99.701699506595% Beneath this tier is 66% of the california population.50-59  = |468383 - 4549|468383 = 463834468383 = 0.99028786271064 = 99.028786271064% For my own ease I will group 60-69 together  = |296123 - 8670|296123 = 287453296123 = 0.9707216258109 = 97.07216258109% So now we start to see a fair danger. Only 97% survival rate in this bracket. 10.9% of the CA population is in this range.70-79  = |139417 - 10513|139417 = 128904139417 = 0.92459312709354 = 92.459312709354% This accounts for 6.6% of the population in California80+  = |97906 - 18214|97906 = 7969297906 = 0.81396441484689 = 81.396441484689%  So by far the most danger to a group accounting for 3.9% of the population.  If you are under 80 years old = |3273650 - 26776|3273650 = 32468743273650 = 0.99182075053839 = 99.182075053839%If you are under 50 years old  = |2367623 - 3034|2367623 = 23645892367623 = 0.99871854598473 = 99.871854598473% How old are you exactly we can find your survival rate exactly.

gi376i6,“They take a synthetic strand of the RNA from the virus itself.” *Which is it — synthetic or from the virus?*“Lipid nanoparticles or whatever.” Quite the scientific explanation.“Just because your body makes antibodies to the virus that doesn’t mean your body will attack it if it invades you.” *Actually that’s exactly what will happen.*“Fake antibodies.”“It could create a habitation for the virus.”“It could merge with the human immune system.” *Where the fuck are you getting this nonsense?*Dude you got so much wrong here no wonder YouTube gave you a warning. The mRNA teaches our cells how to make the spike protein on the COVID-19 virus. It’s this protein that has proven difficult for our immune system to fight the virus. Once our cells produce the spike protein the immune system recognizes these proteins as invaders and destroys it. These spike proteins by themselves are not harmful to us so the body is able to learn without also experiencing the attack of the virus. Eventually the body learns how to effectively destroy the protective layer of the COVID-19 virus and can then destroy the virus.,NotQuiteStableGenius,2021-01-04 17:52:42+00:00,,0.4784090909090909,-0.1693181818181818,Negative,kqd81v,kqd81v

gi1lyju,I had my second vaccine shot earlier this afternoon.I should preface this by saying that my first vaccine shot was pretty unremarkable. I felt only mild arm pain at the injection site for about 2 days and I didn't have any problems with headaches body pain or any other systemic symptoms. I know coworkers who did have problems with a mild headache or body aches so I would say that I was a bit lucky in that respect.With my second shot it's been similarly unremarkable so far but it's only been about 10 hours. It seems like side-effects are more common with the second shot and if it follows the same time-course as shot  1 then it seems like people have been feeling most of their symptoms in the 1-2 days after their shot. So I'm trying to stay aware of the possibility that I may feel something different later this week. For now though it's just been the same arm pain that I had with the first shot.If you want to read my day-by-day cataloguing of my vaccine experience I'll be updating an ongoing thread at   .

I've had several other negative test results previously plus a negative antibody test in the summer so probably haven't had covid.Please make sure you're reporting the longer side effects to employee health or VAERS so that they can track it!

mfekxy,Received 1st Moderna shot 327 at 9am Wanted to give my feedback on my 1st Covid vaccine. Let me begin by saying that I am happy to have finally received my first half of the vaccine and trust the science behind it. With that said I did experience some side effects I'd like to share.327 day of vaccine:The shot itself was virtually painless. It was less noticeable than getting an annual flu shot and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. I had it done in a supermarket pharmacy where they advised me to got walk around the store for a bit and check in with them after 15 minutes before leaving. Easy.I felt a little drowsy a few hours after the injection but after a 45 minute nap I felt on top of the world. Ran some errands went for a walk and enjoyed the rest of the day with no issues besides a slightly sore arm (felt like a mild bruise when I lifted my arm too high). &amp; x200B;328 (today)Here's where the sort of unpleasant symptoms began. I woke up sweatier than usual but nothing too serious. Around 11am I was hit with a moderate headache. Kinda felt similar to being hungover after a night with no sleep. I laid down and slept for a few hours but when I woke up my headache had actually gotten worse. At this point I felt a little annoyed baby the pain but usually with my headaches I get very nauseous and this particular headache didn't make me queasy or nauseous at all just some heavy pounding behind my eyes. I figured since the 24 hour period had passed it was okay for me to take medicine so I took one excedrin migraine and within an hour the pain almost completely vanished. I'm still slightly drowsy but I feel almost 100% again!The headache was worth getting the vaccine without a doubt. I deal with a great bit of anxiety so I am a little nervous about my second dose but I realize that that's completely normal and my symptoms are just an indication that my immune system is working hard for me. Ready for my second poke in 4 weeks!,Redpanda8900,2021-03-29 01:16:02+00:00,5.0,0.4655687830687831,0.0031812169312169,Positive,1,mfekxy
ks3gtg,Moderna Vaccine So about 10 hours ago I got the Moderna vaccine.  I work in a medical facility that works with drug and alcohol addicted individuals and my state classifies me as part of the 1a group and was able to get the first dose. Figured I’d share my experiences so far. Myself 3 of my supervisorsdirectors and a coworker got the vaccine. Of them all I’m the only one feeling any side effects. My arm went a little numb when I got the shot and the woman that gave it to me told me “wait until tomorrow morning” which is always what I want to hear. About an hour later my injection site was sore and it was starting to spread up my neck into my head. Tonight I’ve been getting spasms in my back and diarrhea as well as some really good hot flashes and a fairly decent headache. Brain fog is pretty real for me too. The left side of my body is sore and my left arm continues to lock up with stiffness. I’m slightly worried how I’ll feel tomorrow and more worried about dose 2 but I’d rather deal with a few days of feeling shitty than another year of complete fear. I’ll update tomorrow when I see what life is like then.,bruno5674,2021-01-07 02:27:37+00:00,9.0,0.4428030303030302,0.0664772727272727,Positive,1,ks3gtg

got1pue,I doubt it would interfere.  I have no medical background really...a little.   However I did read that there are no medications listed that interfere with the vaccine.  (Except maybe blood thinners for injection site wound.)  I think it will be fine.  You got lucky!!  ☺  I smoked some after my 2nd vaccine shot today.  Also am taking a few medications. One being an antihistamine which I worried would decrease the potential of the vaccine.  Oh and I just remembered I read a few places that they advise not to take pain medication (Tylenol amdor Ibuprofen) BEFORE the vaccine but it would be ok after.  Good luck!  Congrats for getting vaccinated.  Good for YOU and good for all of us.  Thank you for doing your part!  ☺  And same to anyone else who ia reading this and has or plans to get vaccinated.

gnk0yvg,Not a medical professional but will absolutely concur with those who are saying it sounds like vasovagal response. This happens to me when I get blood drawn or an IV put in and has since I was about 14. A few times they’ve had to use smelling salts on me. I also have several phobias that induce panic responses very much like what you described here. For your next dose ask if you can be injected laying down or reclining. This helps me immensely when possible. When I get vaccinations and blood draws they usually put me in another room with an examination table I can lay on instead of sitting up in a chair. If the vaccine is a drive thru clinic and you are in your car bring someone else to drive you and recline the passenger seat if you can. If this isn’t possible still make sure that you tell them about what happened last time and let them know you are a fainter. They will take proper precautions with you because this thing is actually really common and they are ready for these situations. Don’t look at the needle going in and for me personally it helps if they *don’t* warn me before it goes in by saying things like “you’re going to feel a little pinch” “here it comes” or “it’s about to go in.” The anticipation of needle makes it worse. It sounds like the person administering the vaccine talked to you about possible side effects right before it went in - and that can certainly make someone anxious if they are afraid of needles already. I honestly do better when they just talk about other things while prepping my skin like their dogs or their kids and surprise me with the needle. Like I don’t faint when I get an unexpected paper cut or a bug bite so I react the same way when they just quietly jab me and get done with it. And honestly many vaccinations especially the Moderna vaccine use such small needles you probably won’t feel it much. I didn’t feel mine at all until a few hours later.For vaccines and blood draws they keep me around for about 15 mins afterward since I’m a fainter (which they would do for you anyway since everyone has to wait around after the COVID bad) and sometimes offer me crackers or juice. It may help to bring some crackers and maybe a soft drink or juice box to sip on afterward. Make sure you are hydrated before you go. Bring something to preoccupy your mind while you are waiting for the next dose and after. Best wishes!,alltheprettysongs,2021-02-15 18:01:26+00:00,,0.4904875283446713,0.0129034391534391,Positive,lkhq3c,lkhq3c

gsic8h7,They’re both incredibly effective at keeping you from being hospitalized or dying. Has far efficacy for asymptomatic infection Pfizer and Moderna show higher efficacy. Now there’s a difference though Pfizer’s studies were conducted during our first peak in the US and was primarily targeting the original variant of the virus. J&amp;J’s studies were conducted under the last nasty peak with two major variants underway and studies in multiple countries which lowered asymptomatic efficacy. It is possible that Pfizer would see a reduction in efficacy if up against these other variants that were studied under J&amp;J. But what we do know as of right now all vaccines prevent hospitalizations and death which is the point of the current vaccines. I know people who have already gotten sick with Covid while having peak immunity with Pfizer. But mild sickness.The J&amp;J is nice because it’s one and done.

gja18s3,The exact same thing happened to me yesterday when I got the pfizer vaccine. My normal resting heart rate is 58-62 and it got up to 95-105 about 15 minutes after the shot and stayed up for about 30 minutes (I was wearing my apple watch so it was easy to track). I was wearing an N95 but it also felt hard to breath (I am a very fit runner and have not previously had that issue with the N95). I have no idea whether it was a reaction to the vaccine or a panic attack. My dad is a critical care doc and got Moderna in December and he said some of his colleagues had that happen.  My heart rate was elevated the rest of the evening (in the 70s). Today it is back to normal (and I am tired and have a sore arm but that's it).,atp223,2021-01-14 22:13:49+00:00,,0.4760606060606061,0.0813636363636363,Positive,kx6u2z,kx6u2z

You also might want to stop by the VAERS site at CDC and the British version of that to see some of the side effects of the different Vaccines?I did all three of these things and it was very helpful for me when making a decision whether of not to take an experimental gene therapy that is by definition and legally NOT a vaccine and by definition and legally  is a GMO creating synthetic entity using a system or program that has never been approved by the FDA in 30 years of drug making... made by a company that paid the largest criminal fine in history.

You feel fine on the day of the shot and the reaction kicks in overnight or the next day; older people are less likely to have side effects as their immune response isn’t as strong; overall advice:  don’t worry about the first shot (unless you have had COVID then it will act like a second shot) but be prepared for a possible reaction the day after you receive your second shot.,snailgreen,2021-03-11 04:27:57+00:00,,0.3611111111111111,0.1861111111111111,Positive,m1n3u6,m1n3u6

ktqkfz,Got moderna vaccine yesterday 18 odd side effects I am a health care worker and I got the Moderna first dose yesterday at 1pm.  I had some strange side effects wanted to share and see if anyone else had these? Immediately upon injection i got a strange sensation in my ears like an earache both sides. Went to sit for monitoring and I started experiencing migrane symptoms. Usually when I get migranes I have facial tingling and I got this in various places on my face and eye lids. A mild headache. Of course I got anxious and my throat felt 'tight'. Again it was mild . I left after 30 minutes and this throat feeling persisted for about an hour. I took a benadryl which resolved the throat issue. Migrane symptoms went away a few hours later.  Before bed my face twitched like the muscles tensed up on my left side. Just for a few minutes. Very strange! Woke up this morning and I feel ok just sore arm like most people. I read another post on here about the throat tightness  so maybe im mildly allergic to something in the vaccine? My question is do you think it will be the same or worse for the second dose? Thanks all!,britteadrinker47,2021-01-09 13:03:15+00:00,6.0,0.2807936507936507,0.028062996031746,Positive,1,ktqkfz

llqp31,"Covid vaccine denied at my appointment. Vaccine wasted. I was pregnant and had decided upon getting the vaccine anyway from researching about it and as far as I was aware the guidelines state that although there is a lack of evidence on how it affects pregnancy it should be up to the individual to weigh their own risks. Originally I was invited via my work but my GP invite came over the weekend as I am within their vulnerable classes (wasn't aware of this until now)I unfortunately am miscarrying. Very early at about 4.5 weeks. I am painfully sure about this but even if I wasn't then I would want the vaccine anyway. I had a few days of positive tests that got lighter until they have been negative since. Went to my appointment they ask they question if I am pregnant or trying for a baby. She explained you cannot have it if you are pregnant. Like no discussion you just can't have it. She didn't even ask about my role within adult social care and whether I was at a high risk via visiting people.. She said that you have to wait 3 months to try for a baby after the vaccine (again as far as I am aware guidelines we updated at the end of December to say there is no reason to hold of trying for a baby after)I explain my situation about miscarrying and the nurse asks me if I had a scan to confirm (idk why as she should surely know that you can't see anything on a scan until about 6 weeks...) Asks me if I have started bleeding yet and how long for. She then says she needs to talk to the GP. She then comes back and is like no sorry you can't have it we need to wait a week. I aks her what if I want to make the chocie to have it today and she said ""sorry we are following the guidelines"" and sent me away. Very unhappy I asked my partner to call the surgery as I was very distressed by this. The receptionist spoke with the gp while we were on hold and confirmed I had to wait a week before I could make another appointment for the vaccine. She confirmed that the vaccines have to be used within one day so this vaccine for me which was unused today will be destroyed as I was there last patient for the day. We asked why do I have to wait a week and she just stated because that's what the GP said. We said what exactly are they worried about as I have misscarried and there is no risk to any baby at the moment and the receptionist seemed to be responding at the top of her head saying ""we need to think about the health of mum thats why we need to wait a week"". We asked for a copy of the guidelines that they are following as it seems our if date to our knowledge and she said she is unable to give that information. Just so angry that I was denied having it wrongly. That they didn't have any kind of discussion with me. That they took away my chocie. That they seem to be giving out outdated recommendations. That they wasted a vaccine for no good reason when people are desperate for it.",Pengu1nGirl,2021-02-17 09:36:00+00:00,1.0,0.5515886134067952,0.0249001377410468,Positive,1,llqp31

gmo8sng,I was on a call with representatives from our continental CDC last week (all of the countries in our region link up for a massive CDC-type organisation so we can share data) and we discussed the safety of COVID-19 vaccines given the reports of some deaths in nursing homes after people received the vaccine.In one country they would expect 300 to 400 people to die in their nursing homes. Over the course of several weeks they had just over 50 reported deaths in the days and weeks after receiving a dose of one of the vaccines. Investigations into the deaths are ongoing but for all of those that they've done so far the patients died of natural causes nothing induced by vaccination. The rate of deaths in their nursing homes hasn't gone up since the launch of the vaccination programme which is pretty good evidence that people are getting vaccinated and are just getting on with their lives. Some residents died in the days or weeks after vaccination indeed but you'd expect _more_ deaths each week if that was vaccine-related.To be really blunt here when you start vaccinating the most elderly and frail in the population it is _inevitable_ that some of them will die in the weeks following vaccination. If you follow a large group of elderly andor frail people for several weeks then many of them will die regardless of what you're trying to study.One member of my family has already been vaccinated. I've got an elderly relative who's eligible and who I will drive to the hospital personally once she receives the date &amp; time of her appointment. When it's my turn you can be sure I'll be first in line for my doses.,TheFlyingMunkey,2021-02-09 06:42:15+00:00,,0.464076858813701,0.2007518796992481,Positive,lfvb4i,lfvb4i

mi1qm9,Hepatitis B vaccine and COVID vaccine (Sinovac) at very close interval? (Sorry if my English is not easy to understand) I have just received my first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine earlier last month and I will be receiving my second shot on April 10. The thing is that due to my occupation I am on a priority list to receive COVID vaccine scheduled on April 07 just 3 days before my Hepatitis B second shot. If I miss this chance to get COVID vaccine I don't know when I will be able to get it again without having any prioritized invitation. I cannot seem to find good resources online about other COVID vaccines regarding this kind of issue and it is even harder to get clear information about this Chinese Sinovac vaccine.  Should I be concerned? Is it likely to cause health problem or is it going to only reduce the effectiveness of one or both vaccines? I asked some of my friends working in medical field and they had no advice for me.,monamana,2021-04-01 18:30:51+00:00,2.0,0.4145833333333333,0.0641666666666666,Positive,1,mi1qm9

ktaj7b,My reaction to the Moderna vaccine Hi everyone. I am a essential worker I work in the medical field. I went to go get my vaccine (moderna) this morning and I immediately started feeling tingles in my fingers. The office started getting nervous because that was followed by dizziness and numbness of the entire vaccinated side of my body. Then my vision started to become foggy and I felt in like a dream like state. All I was doing was sitting there crossing my fingers that I wasn’t going to pass out. When I started to get sweats they called a code vaccine and rushed me to the ER (I was being vaccinated at a hospital.) I was monitored for an hour and blood was drawn. All my blood work came back normal and eventually I was sent home. Before I was sent home I felt the numbness and tingling to going away. But when I stepped down oh my feet from the bed I noticed my foot in a lot of pain. And when the bottom of my foot is pressed it worsens. After about 30 minutes that disappeared. I figured OK I had a reaction but I’m OK. Now the tingling in numbness is back in my hands and foot. I’m starting to worry that it might be neuropathy.Has anyone who has been vaccinated had any symptoms similar to mine? I’m starting to get very concerned.,bpage0306,2021-01-08 20:06:23+00:00,8.0,0.2895299145299145,0.0918803418803418,Positive,1,ktaj7b

Running a high fever nausea body aches. Sweating. I had covid before and I have been positive for the antibodies. I thought that if I got the vaccine my body wouldn’t really react to it since I already had the antibodies. Why am I still feeling so sick from this shot? It has been since Saturday when I got it. I don’t understand why this is so if my body has the antibodies already and has done what a vaccine is trying to accomplish. It is now Wednesday (?) and I haven’t had a fever in 2 days but I still have body aches and congestion and just overall feel sick. Am I dying from this shot?

gl26zre,I’m critical of the vaccine hype period as I think it’s overblown and unlikely to make that much difference in fact I’d call it a hope and a prayer.Firstly most vaccines at best give 90% protection meaning 10% will still become infected and if only 2.5% need ventilation or hospitalisation in a country like the uk that will mean over 68 thousand people still needing hospitalisation.Plus if you factor in the amount of people who’ll decide not to have the vaccine or the fact that likely the vaccine won’t stop the spread by inoculated people it’s a fiasco.You will never control covid 19 with lockdowns as it will only spread when society is released and its dubious how effective the vaccine program will be.Also the cost is immense as the virus will be forced to mutate to circumnavigate the vaccines that have been created and in time many vaccines will be inefficient or totally useless meaning more research more cost for the tax payer and more profit for pharma companies.They won’t beat COVID 19 period it will be here and around for ever unless it mutates into a weaker strain and everybody is covering up the truth even the outbreak source is pointing not to wet markets in China but Laboratories in china.,LordHogMouth,2021-01-28 07:07:51+00:00,,0.5881944444444445,0.14375,Positive,l66iwf,l66iwf

gi5obwc,There shouldn't be any problems with the COVID vaccines and birth control pills. That's not a known problem with other vaccines and there's no known interaction or theory is this case either.Mechanistically certain medications can lower the effectiveness of oral contraceptives by increasing the activity of CYP450 enzymes (which are a type of enzyme made in the liver that commonly breaks down drugs). If you take another drug that increases CYP450 enzyme activity then you'll increase the breakdown of oral conceptives and lower the effectiveness of your birth control.However the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines aren't known to have an effect on CYP450 enzymes. And for context drugs that affect oral contraception usually have a **big** effect on CYP450 enzyme activity. So if the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were to affect oral contraception they would need to have a big effect on CYP450 and by that measure they would screw up a lot of other drugs in the same process.But we haven't seen that issue with really any drug much less oral contraceptives. So I would say you don't need to worry about it.,Garfield3d,2021-01-05 06:49:55+00:00,,0.2683621933621934,-0.0643578643578643,Negative,kq8w1v,kq8w1v

Slightly higher than usual temperature 36 hours after (99) with steady arm soreness.  No other symptoms noted.  Felt tired  but I’ve work 7-days a week since May so it is hard to say if fatigue is vaccine related or just normal exhaustion.  48 hours after and arm soreness has lessened greatly.  60 hours later it has disappeared entirely.   No other symptoms noted. I have severe environmental allergies that can lead to asthmatic conditions.  No food allergies or allergies to medicine or other vaccines.

It is not like he is someone from a low risk group trying to score a vaccine destined for those with high risk. Of course if you argue from a nation state perspective thus implying that people from certain wealthy nations have some inherent right to survive a pandemic because of their citizenship you might find my request unethical.

ghmlzik,I live in Texas and received my vaccine as part of 1A. From my understanding you will not have to have a doctor or “proof” of your condition but this appears to be county dependent. Most vaccine sites are basically just having you fill out a form online stating you have so and so condition. It seems to be based a bit on the honor system more than anything. I highly doubt you’d have to show a doctor’s note regarding obesity. I would sign up for the newsletters for the vaccine from various vaccine sites so you can be informed when the vaccine allotment has been given to the site. Even though 1B has been approved to receive the vaccine as of Tuesday it appears they are still trying to vaccinate the healthcare workers in 1A and we will be given continued priority. My friend falls into 1B and various sites said they have not received their 1B allotment yet but I expect that to change by next week. Here are some resources below on where and how to get a vaccine. Tarrant County and Denton county health services have a nice sign up option it allows you to pre register and basically you will be on the wait list to receive the vaccine for when the next allotment comes. If you don’t mind driving over to them then it’s not a bad option. Market street pharmacy also has a solid program but you will have to pre register and I would sign up for their email list that will add more market street locations as vaccines are received.Full list of vaccine distributors in Texas : Tarrant County Health Signup:Denton County Health Signup:Market Street,Luna920,2020-12-31 18:22:13+00:00,,0.4422222222222222,0.2288636363636363,Positive,knub2n,knub2n

m6pnks,Does the first dose affect Covid test results? Also should I ensure that I'm Covid negative before getting the first dose? Hi all Just made my appointment for my first dose and it's fast approaching. Just wanted to ask these couple questions. I plan to do some research but wanted to get this post up first.First does the first dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine potentially mess with Covid tests between doses or indefinitely? I plan to visit an older family member at the end of the month (27th). Should all be fairly low risk but I plan to quarantine until then and get tested just beforehand just in case. My appointment for my first dose of the vaccine is in two days. Would this possibly affect the accuracy of the test? False positivenegative? Any info anyone could provide or link to would be appreciated.Next let's say hypothetically I was in a situation today of moderate risk. My appointment would be close enough that any test taken between now and then would probably not come back positive even if I were infected. Is this an issue in any way? Were this the case should I wait until I get a negative test a little further down the line so I'm confident in the negative? Additionally is getting tested prior to a vaccination standard or do they perform a test on site? Or does it not really matter?Thanks all.,LittleBummerBoy,2021-03-17 02:12:28+00:00,3.0,0.3824106449106449,0.0163801476301476,Positive,1,m6pnks

gnd99lg,Just my two cents. The first shot primes your immune system to make antibodies. Will you be slightly less primed? Maybe. Significantly less primed? Doubtful. Especially since it's the second shot that produces the antibodies. If you don't take anything to interfere with the immune response which includes meds that reduce pain fever and inflammation (all parts of the immune response) you should be fully protected.Did you have any side effects after the first shot? Even arm pain or an itchy injection side would indicate your immune system is working just fine. And if you didn't have any side effects it's still probably working just fine as many people don't have noticeable reactions.,EvanMcD3,2021-02-14 06:50:23+00:00,,0.42,0.07,Positive,ljcler,ljcler

gqs2z2b,I didn't. But it's pretty harmless. Lymph nodes are a part of our lymphatic system in which immune cells are presented with a foreign antigen (protein of a microbe). They get larger in an immune response such as when we get sick or in this case: a harmless spike protein created from your own cells using mRNA in the vaccine. It's very common to get reactive lymphadenapathy in many illnesses and is just a reaction to the immune response. Just means body is doing it's job and it usually it just takes some time to go away. I see it as a good thing with these vaccines as it looks like you're getting a really strong and effective immune response which may mean better immunity. Personally I had mono before and lymph nodes were swollen for weeks. Same with strep throat. Not bothersome or harmful. With cancer you are probably thinking of lymphoma which is not what is happening here.,Spartan9442,2021-03-13 07:31:18+00:00,,0.570498511904762,0.1119717261904761,Positive,m3xpk4,m3xpk4

You’re simply taking at face value what is told or shared with you and you’re choosing that to be the information YOU believe. The same way those of us who read about the adverse affects are taking that as our information that matters to us. There is no “right or wrong” in what we believe individually in this case. There have been deaths of OTHERWISE healthy people shortly after receiving these vaccines. Would they had been fine had they not taken it? We will never know and you can’t prove otherwise. No one can. So just because you have your facts and we have ours doesn’t mean yours is the correct one.,aperez11313,2021-03-17 12:36:51+00:00,,0.5065476190476189,0.0116341991341991,Positive,gr87ood,m6blm2

gi0q6gp,&gt; Isn't an autoimmune reaction possible though? There may be a very small chance of one. There are also autoimmune reactions to the virus and there have been dozens you may have missed because they're also rare relative to the number of cases and deaths.&gt;  I disagree with the risk assessment part too because my chances of getting COVID are like 5-10%20 million Americans have gotten it this year and we keep shattering daily records with months of winter still left. The only way your chances of getting it don't rise is if other people get it and become immune or other people get vaccinated.

If it doesn’t help in the first 36 hours then I will start prednisone and it’s not recommended I get the 2nd vaccine.,Smilesunshine57,2021-01-14 17:11:17+00:00,,0.2333333333333333,0.18,Positive,kvx0wn,kvx0wn

m45bab,Heart palpitation after Pfizer vaccination I want to share my experience and maybe someone will benefit from it or shine more light onit.First im a health invaluable i don't have any serious health problem as i know. i admit i had in the past heart palpitations in every once a month or 2 months and it was like an one second of a feeling and it was pass away.After my first dose of Pfizer vaccine in 2 days heart palpitation starts and it's like couple times a day lasting from 1 min to couple hours almost never had this experiences with heart palpitations.Taking the second dose now its worse. feeling it every day a couple times im sure 100% it has something to do with the vaccine. dont know if its and serious health harm or it's not because there is type of heart palpitations.Planning to get EKG device to monitor my situation  i hope it not that serious and more important i hope it will subside and a few days or weeks to come.Hope it helps someone out there and if anyone has some information about this subject i will love to knowץ,Crazyhunter676,2021-03-13 12:25:53+00:00,12.0,0.4591503267973856,0.0607843137254901,Positive,1,m45bab

ger7j66,China has developed a vaccine and the timeline of testing and development is fairly similar to the Pfizer vaccine: Additionally their internal response was much quicker which lead to fewer deaths. They shut down essentially everything for almost 3 months and citizens were more willing to wear masks and abide the lockdown regulations.China was hit very hard by SARS not long ago and developed stronger epidemic response as a result.,LetshearitforNY,2020-12-06 00:20:08+00:00,,0.3766414141414141,0.0582070707070707,Positive,k7isu5,k7isu5
lkhq3c,Effect from 1st Moderna Dose Hey all I've come to share my experience from my first Moderna dose that I received about a week ago. Starting off I'm a (fairly) healthy 21yo male. I was on multiple waiting lists for maybe a month until I was finally able to get my appointment. I have a history of minor allergic reactions to penicillin type drugs and solid fear of any needle going into my body. So I was worried about the needle as I usually feel like I'm going to pass out at the sight or thought but this time I was more excited to have it done.As I go into the open area of volunteer physicians administering the vaccine I'm feeling good! The doctor and nurse were very friendly and comforting so I felt like I was in good hands. I give the doc a warning about my fear and he administers it before I could even tell it was ready! It was a pleasant experience so far.After he put my bandaid on he started explaining potential soreness and things I could do and take to help alleviate the soreness in my arm. About 1 minute into his spiel (2 minutes after administration) I started to feel off as if I was nauseated and wanted to throw up. This was proceeded by a wave of coldness that started in my upper body and bled to all of my extremities. I then began to profusely sweat until they called over a paramedic. He hooked up the wires to me (presumedly an ECG) took my blood pressure and O2 saturation. I'm not not sure what my heart rate was but I didn't notice any rapid beat or slower beat. My O2 was normal but my blood pressure had dropped to 7035 in just a matter of minutes. At this point (5 minutes after administration) I was scared I was possibly going to die or pass out at minimum. An ambulance has been called and I'm afraid for my wellbeing. All of a sudden (6 minutes since onset of symptoms 8 minutes since administration) I was feeling better WAY better. Not 2 minutes ago an ambulance was rushing to take me to the hospital now I'm feeling just as good as I walked into the place. My blood pressure rises back to normal.  No epinephrine was administered only time and sitting down. I leave from the chair where my physicians are just as confused as I am and take a seat in the observation room with a sweat soaked shirt and a crowd of people giving me stares. I know I probably should have gone to the hospital like they wanted me to and I know I probably should have had someone pick me up. But I sat for 15 minutes feeling just fine and drove myself back home as if nothing had happened. I also signed myself up for the 2nd dose while I was there. Can anybody give me an idea if this was nerves or if I actually had a reaction to the vaccine? I may just be young and dumb enough to go back for the 2nd (worst) dose and accept that the same thing might occur. Gotta love that pandemic pressure!,KennyBP,2021-02-15 16:58:01+00:00,11.0,0.4617283950617284,0.1073765432098765,Positive,1,lkhq3c

Dr.Panet stated that the current vaccines will be less effective and we would need revacination every year. In addition it might affect the traveling because there will be many variants in different countries.

lqahko,Bad reaction to vaccine I had Covid Dec 10th my first vaccine at the end of December and my Second Jan 17th. Woke up around 1am that night and my arm was on fire. Figured it would go away and was just an immune reaction but it hasn’t. It’s been a month and it has gotten progressively worse. I’ve had severe pain loss of movement and weird circulation issues. I have a history of autoimmune disease so I don’t know if that has anything to do with it.  My imaging and EMG are normal and my doctors have no idea why this is happening. Has anyone else had a bad reaction to the vaccine? I reported my issues to VAERS. I’d appreciate it if moderators left this up. No other site is allowing discussion of anything negative about the vaccine and I’m tired of it. I’m not asking for medical advice I’m asking if anyone else is having these issues but keep getting my question discarded.

ku4wrb,"Was money the only factor in creating a vaccine so quickly? I've been trying to understand how we got the vaccine so quickly.  Most of the sources are explaining that we've combined years of research on other factors (such as mRNA and SARS research) with the intense research in the last year and we also allocated all of our resources into this process.  I understand both of those help but I'm still concerned.  It took us less than year to get a vaccine which is just not normal.  It seems that steps had to have been skipped in the trial process.  Are there any sources out there saying steps were skipped or was it really just all the money we put into it?  Let me clarify - I do want to get and plan on getting the vaccine.

ghgppmc,What does long-term mean? 1 year 2 years 5 years. These vaccines were developed using established platforms that have been studied over the past ten years. Sequencing the SARS CoV2 was a major step forward. And we got the sequence from Chinese scientists. Creating the mRNA sequence and the nanolipid particle vector were the final pieces. Then came the clinical trials. If the government did not put in the tremendous resources they did and the scientific community did not come together to share data and our expertise we would not be here today with two Covid vaccines with good safety profiles and 95% efficacy in preventing COVID-19.Here is an analogy:If I am building a new house today I am happy to know there are materials and technology available that have been used studied and shown to be useful to my goals of building that house. I am glad that I do not have to discover cement metal beams tiles wood tractors etc. and how to put them together to build the house.And when the house is built I will move in and live there. I do not need long-term data to tell me it is ok to reside there safely. I will hire engineers and inspectors to test its safety and effectiveness as an abode in the short-term using approved methods and protocols (just like clinical trials).,trininyc2020,2020-12-30 03:32:34+00:00,,0.5112967914438502,0.2297682709447415,Positive,ghflb09,kmmip2

Many medications over the years have been labeled as safe initially only for it to result in deaths and side effects later. Diet pill Finfin (I believe that's how you spell it) caused deaths. Birth control pill Yaz caused death and severe side effects for many woman. Also the 2 shot series for swine flu shot from the 1978's I think was the time caused severe side effects in patients despite being initially labeled as safe.

gsog14h,Yes we are pretty much COVID free with serious lockdown during outbreak in March April 2020 and now we have only some restrictions like mandated masks in public places no nightlife (but restaurants are packed!) some work and gathering restrictions. Vaccination has rolled out with Pfizer and Moderna for high risk middle aged to elderly and they are doing serious screening and turning people away if you had history of allergies or other conditions. I know someone in their 40s who was turned away for a penicillin allergy. Thats why I think also there are few adverse side effects here.To me COVID is definitely serious but it's not the virus that kills it's age comorbidities and a weak healthcare system. That is why we only had 30 deaths with 60k infections in the last year. Otherwise how can we explain it? The minute someone tests positive here they are isolated and watched closely even if you have zero symptoms. In the US I believe you are told to rest at home and only get treatment when symptoms get worse. Think we offer Remdesevir very early on too when it's most effective. And some were on HCQ (anecdotally I heard from a few Drs) before the world laughed at Trump.,imtakingcreddit,2021-03-29 12:05:14+00:00,,0.5128661616161616,0.0319696969696969,Positive,gsmt8zn,mepbie

It seems pretty normal but check out Twitter if you want some reassurance haha,shrkzz,2021-01-23 01:59:06+00:00,,0.5187499999999999,0.15,Positive,l32ck5,l32ck5

gga33vv,Yes.  Some people CAN'T take the vaccine or it won't work for them because of various medical conditions so just for there sake alone we need to continue to take precautions until it's no longer widely circulating.  But also as a matter of personal safety you won't necessarily have an easy way of determining how strong your personal immune response was to the vaccine and thus how protected you are.  AND it hasn't yet been demonstrated that the vaccine stops you from spreading the virus.  It's only known that 95% of the time it prevents you from becoming ill to the extent that you'd recognize that you caught it.,Reneeisme,2020-12-18 18:51:08+00:00,,0.6287878787878789,0.0651515151515151,Positive,gga2k50,kfnj1g

gqkr4h4,There are a lot of research groups and companies that have used an adenovirus as a vector in the past for vaccines against HIV Ebola flu and gene therapies for cystic fibrosis etc. I honestly can’t think of one that has worked well enough that it passed all trials etc except for the Johnson and Johnson. The ones that I can think of are live attenuated but that doesn’t mean that adenoviral vectors are garbage-they are useful. They have studied them for a long time and as with every new technology they haven’t gotten all the kinks out. So basically there are a lot of vaccines that have been made using adenoviral vectors but they just didn’t mount a strong immune response or had difficulties during trials that they never made it to production.Now that’s not to say this J&amp;J vaccine is garbage and you shouldn’t take it if it’s available and you can take it by all means! But if you had a choice I would pick the mRNA vaccines over adeno.Basically if you sometime in the past came into contact with an adeno of the same vector used in the vaccine in this case of the HIV vaccine adenovirus-5. If you came into contact with ad5 naturally and then received the ad5 vector HIV vaccine your natural ad5 antibodies that you already made from the prior infection would most likely attack and neutralize the vaccine vector and suppress the immune response that was supposed to take place when given the vaccine. It basically would be pointless regarding your immune system since it would degrade the vaccine and be as if you never got it in the first place. I don’t think they have tested that with the covid adeno vaccine and they are using a different serotype adeno27 instead of adeno5. So it may happen or it may not happen with the covid vaccine but physicians are worried that it could happen. The article I’m talking about (the physicians being worried) is here: They explain it probably more elegantly than me lmao,THelperCell,2021-03-11 14:36:04+00:00,,0.4971179183135705,0.1540678524374176,Positive,gqjywdm,m2hfh5

The big unknown is how long the efficacy of the vaccine lasts over time. It's bound to go down with mutations (this is normal with the flu vaccine too) but the question is how much. I would not be surprised if we need to get it once a year since it's been a year and we are seeing two mutations already.

m6gpm1,Scared... (got the first dose a week and a half ago) I’m got my vaccine not too long ago. A week and a half to be exact. I’m still really run down and tired from it. My parents keep scaring me tell me I’ll have severe side effects in the future and my immune system is get ruined. But out of that fear I’ve been looking online and a lot of people have died from the vaccine or so it says. I’m really scared I don’t want to die and now I’m regretting getting the vaccine.

gr2oa0c,Allergic reaction they are concerned about is anaphylaxis which is an allergic response that requires Epinephrine to treat it. It is life threatening if not treated which is why they ask you to stay for 15-30 minutes after so they can observe you and give you the treatment if needed. The symptoms are typically the throat closing hives and trouble breathing. There will be no doubt if someone is having this reaction. And they are trained to look for the signs. Anxiety can cause similar symptoms but is not an allergic reaction but something you are doing to yourself. They will be able to tell the difference. However side effects are different from allergic reaction. Vaccines will cause side effects and this is NOT an allergic response. Side effects are from the vaccine working snd providing immunity. Your body feels ill while it’s building protection. Side effects like headache nausea fever chills and body aches are normal and to be expected. These do not require medical treatment and will pass on their own. Tylenol is a good remedy for pains like these. Overall the outcome should be fine. Some will have a reaction both in the allergic form and the non allergic form. Both are easily treatable. Of all the people I know who have been vaccinated no one I know had an allergic anaphylactic reaction but about 50 percent have normal side effects that pass in a day or two. I had my first Pfizer and was feeling ill for 48 hours. I have my second in a few days and I suspect it will be similar. The goal is that the vaccine will be easier on the body than covid. Hope she has a easy time. Best of luck.,jcnlb,2021-03-16 01:05:08+00:00,,0.4965909090909091,0.1348484848484848,Positive,m5iiuk,m5iiuk

gsn6sf0,Ok--first I'm pro-vaccine. Shoot me up baby. But I had a horrible experience with my second Pfizer. Please go see your urgent care doctor and get a chest x-ray.I had horrible fever with my second Pfizer shot. Over 103. 48 hours later a feeling of tightness in my chest and problems breathing. I got shot  2 8am March 4. 9pm March 7 Urgent Care diagnosed me with pneumonia.I'm serious. I have pneumonia. I'm on my second course of antibiotics; it's been 21 days since I was diagnosed. 24 days since the shot. I haven't been back to work and have had to go onto short-term disability. Thankfully my company has generous disability benefits.No I don't have covid. I've had two negative covid PCR tests (plus a negative flu test) since my second shot. It's plain old pneumonia. Best anyone can figure is that it's either unrelated or somehow the second Pfizer shot temporarily crapped out my immune system leaving me open to pneumonia. And I was pretty healthy going into the shot.I've been really sick--my blood oxygen has been as low as 85. Had the urgent care doc not insisted on a chest x-ray I might have ended up in the hospital.

lsh0zw,Question about vaccine Genuine question and it might be a stupidnaive one - not a medical-minded individual really at all I’m just a very curious one. I’m from the UK where vaccine rollout is going steady and well. Government ministers have suggested that we need to hit a % population vaccinated before we can get back to ‘normal’ (whatever that means) and it’s quite a high % especially when you take into account that children aren’t yet receiving the vaccine. Seen a lot of people on various feeds of mine both strangers and people I know expressing anti-vax opinions and stances stating firmly they’re not getting it. If there’s no convincing these people and they lower the % of the overall population vaccinated what then? Do we keep restrictions in place until they oblige? Do we get on as normal and just let them go about their normal business unprotected? Would that affect the rest of the population in any way?Realise I’m speaking in hypotheticals and I don’t know if these questions are even worth asking at this point.

gr53aq0,there's no reason to worry excessively about an allergic reaction if that's the question. Typical allergic reactions are hives or similar and typically manageable with a benadryl. Anything worse you would obviously go to a hospital for anything like tonguethroat swelling just as you would finding out someone is allergic to bee stings. the answer is: yes allergic reactions can happen at any time in life unexpectedly even if you've shown no previous sensitivities. However you have no more reason to be concerned over an allergic reaction to the covid vaccine than coloring your hair.,DasKittySmoosh,2021-03-16 16:59:18+00:00,,0.5740740740740741,-0.1166666666666666,Negative,gr52el7,m6bdma

ggbia5p,I’m allergic to bee stings and penicillin and while I can totally avoid the latter bees are a really threat to me. I carry an epi pen and I’ve used it twice. I’ve had two sting episodes and they are terrifying. The pcn caused anaphylactic shock while I was a child and it was after a tonsillectomy and I was still in the hospital. I don’t remember all the details but my mom recounted them to me. I have never received a flu shot nor ever had the flu. I do have some juvederm fillers and Botox and I’ve heard that these also can interact badly. It’s not really clear what the interaction is. Juvederm is primarily hyaluronic acid a naturally occurring substance in our bodies. There is a warning label associated with it that has something to do with how it’s made. Botox is bacterial in origin. Egg allergy is a response to the protein in the eggs I think. But I’ve read that concentrated genetic material like eggs can trigger a response. Nonetheless I’d be really careful. I have an autoimmune condition called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and my doc says that I shouldn’t have any vaccines without testing my anti thyroid antibodies first. I’d consult a doc and not someone pushing a vaccine but somebody with a healthy dose of skepticism.,Powerful-Size-1444,2020-12-19 02:03:02+00:00,,0.5066666666666666,0.0299999999999999,Positive,kb46tz,kb46tz

goq63r2,"**NAD -** I feel like no one studies these things bc it's ""not a big deal"" but my period was a little later than normal after the vaccine. I'm also really sensitive to everything like changes in food caffeine etc. and when you really think about it your body is doing something different. Like it has to spend a lot of energy making an immune response so I don't think it's totally crazy that it might be a little different than the usual routine. Plus when your body responds to something foreign it sends inflammatory signals (like PGE-somenumber) which also affect estrogen receptors. I think it's not weird for things to change for a couple months. I think a doctor will tell you it's probably not related bc it could be like 8 million and 1 things including that maybe you were nervous about getting the vaccine?

Therefore I wonder what would you do in my situation? I’m young and healthy as it is. And I don’t want to risk this.

got35f9,Well I feel if you've waited a couple weeks after your 2nd vaccine that's about as good as you can do.  And yes you may want to get tested just to be sure since the vaccine isn't 100% effective.  Just be careful because even Covid tests can give false negatives.  AND they are saying at this point they aren't sure if we can be carriers somehow after vaccination.  But overall I say go for it.  😊  Enjoy them.

gquhrzl,Honestly even though I’m so appreciative when people do the right thing for others especially in this day and age I’m also trying not to judge anyone else’s circumstances because I know how scarce the vaccine is and how desperate and scared people feel. I certainly feel anxious to get my own jabs not being eligible yet and having my own vulnerabilities. That’s why I understood on some level how hard it had to be to turn down an opportunity like the one you did. I wouldn’t have blamed you if you’d made another choice and yet I thought it was so kind that you thought of others. I know scarcity brings out a lot of fear and also the best and worst in people. In your friend’s situation my personal feeling — not that it’s for me to say — is that I’m glad she got it. She is legitimately in the veterinary field even if she’s not yet employed (she will be). In some states one autoimmune condition alone would qualify you. So the rollout is definitely uneven from state to state. Autoimmune illnesses are often misunderstood and anyone I know who’s been living with chronic illness from way before covid struck us all has already been living with compromise. I just wish everyone who wanted it could get the vaccine right now.

lwvtxy,U.S. Catholic Church issues statement regarding Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine ethical concerns The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement yesterday reiterating ethical concerns over the newly authorized Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine: [As the Conference said of the AstraZeneca vaccine in December 2020 the statement noted that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine “raises questions about the moral permissibility of using vaccines developed tested andor produced with the help of abortion-derived cell lines.” Though such cells are not actually in the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine (in other words the vaccine is not developed from aborted fetuses as some have claimed) the Conference noted that such cell lines were used in the development testing and production of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. By comparison those cell lines were only used in the testing of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Despite these ethical concerns the Conference stated that where there is no choice it is morally acceptable to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. However if the option is available the Conference encouraged that Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines should be chosen over Johnson &amp; Johnson’s. As it has in the past the Conference reiterated the importance of getting vaccinated saying that “given the world-wide suffering that this pandemic is causing we affirm again that being vaccinated can be an act of charity that serves the common good.”Ethical concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines particularly the AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines are nothing new. They’ve been discussed for some time even when not covered in the media. They are one part of the challenge Americans will increasingly face as they are confronted with choosing from multiple vaccines for COVID-19. Add to this issue other questions about which vaccine is more effective safer and faster. We are beginning to see what Dr. Gregory Poland the director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic warned of last fall regarding the many emerging vaccines “It has not yet dawned on hardly anybody the amount of complexity and chaos and confusion that will happen in a few short months.” ([,COVID_VacciNATION,2021-03-03 14:59:55+00:00,4.0,0.4172111742424242,0.0608664772727272,Positive,1,lwvtxy

I think that allows them to not have to program it different across the country depending on what vaccine each store has.  From what I know by experience I'd say it's not worth the headache to try to reschedule it earlier.  You won't be able to change it until the day before.  You could try to book a new 2nd dose appt when you're close to the 21 day mark.  Or call 1-800-walgreens to reschedule but you may be on hold for an hour.  Or you could just not worry about it and get it at 28 days and save the headache of trying to change it.

ggn5p7b,Everyone was tested for antibodies i believe. Idk what you know and don't know but remember that antibody titer doesn't necessarily equate to immunity. There could be some memory T-cell immunity which we have yet to study in humans. And in terms of the other 10% I'm not sure why they got a detectable virus. All you can conclude as you probably know is that in a double blind study it shows 90% effectiveness based on who did and who didn't get the virus in the placebo vs vaccine groups. And in terms of minority population they probably should do more studies and I wouldn't be surprised if it was a systemic societal issue instead of a purely biological reason for minorities getting hit worse with the virus. In terms of severe covid-19 the Pfizer vaccine only had one case in the vaccine group. The Moderna vaccine had no severe covid-19 in the vaccine group. And in terms of minorities in the Moderna study they had less or no infections compared to  white non hispanics. This doesn't necessarily conclude that the Moderna vaccine protects minorities more than non hispanic whites but it is showing effectiveness. One can hope it builds confidence for vaccines in minority communities that are hesitant due to their history especially in the black community of unethical vaccine testing on them.And woo!

gwbkpn6,Vaccines do not have long-term effects. When you talk about long-term effects of vaccines it means up to 30 days. Effects of vaccines comes immediately afterwards 95% in the first four days. Side-effects after 30 days are impossible. A vaccine isn't really a big thing. You just give knowledge about the virus to your T killer cells. After a few days there is nothing in your body anymore. Only the knowledge the killer cells acquired remains. The reason we need to inject mostly a dead virus is because we cannot talk to the cells directly and tell the cells about the virus.,Moonwalking_Eren,2021-04-29 17:32:29+00:00,,0.4761904761904761,-0.1023809523809523,Negative,gwbc8ej,n0upo3

But a lot of these vaccines get improved over time.  &amp; x200B;The issues are many here.  We do not know that impact the vaccines or the virus itself.  We have scientific data that suggests that the virus does damage to a good percentage of asymptomatic cases.  We know that symptomatic cases see damage to varying degrees.&amp; x200B;On top of that we have seen data that people with moderate to severe cases can lose antibodies in less than a year from the virus itself.

And don’t forget (this helped me): even if you do feel side effects you’re not “really” sick! Usually the hardest part of feeling sick is worrying what it will turn into. In this case it’s all just your body’s immune reaction and not a real virus at all. So it’s just about getting through any physical sensations as comfortably as possible.

gplytrf,mRNA is NOT new vaccine technology. It was developed in 1989 which means its older than me (I’m 28). I have had the first dose of Pfizer. It didn’t feel any worse than any other shot I’ve gotten. One piece of advice is as soon as you get it to move your arm in all directions as much as possible. I did it about every 5 mins (lifted reached shifted front and back bentstraightened etc) and was only sore for ~24 hrs and even that was mild. I had a little bit of sinus pressure the next day (kinda how you feel at the onset of a cold) but then it went away. You can take otc meds like Tylenol or pepto bismol if you are having any discomfort but I didn’t need anything. Other than the sore arm I was a bit more tired than usual.

Overall news reports may say there are delays in vaccination while the vaccine clinic will still be able to get you in.    Overall the trial studies did not look at what happens if you delay the second vaccine dose. However there is proof that 10+ days after the first shot your body does start having a good immune response. However we do not know if that immune response will last if you do not get the second shot.    There is some consideration that you can delay the second shot by a couple of weeks but it's best to get it as close to on schedule as possible. ,LadybirdFarmer,2021-01-19 15:22:01+00:00,,0.2659090909090909,0.2227272727272727,Positive,l0l5yi,l0l5yi
gei1ztd,In the simplest terms if the virus finds no hosts it dies.  The infected person kills it off or dies and if the virus has no where to go it dies.  Repeat that over the course of a whole population and there's no virus circulating and even though people's immunity wears off they don't become re-infected because there's no virus in the environment. Of course that won't actually happen because not everyone will take the vaccine or have recently caught the virus and share universal immunity all at the same time but if you can approach 90 - 95% of people having that immunity simultaneously and for a period of a few weeks you can make it so that the few people who are sharing it have decreasing chances to pass it to someone else and eventually reach the same result (nowhere for the virus to go).  For every percentage point fewer people with immunity the longer you have to maintain simultaneous immunity for that to work.  All we can do is try.

I was doing some research and I discovered that as many as 10% to 15% of people getting the Moderna vaccine have showed enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit chest and neck. To be more precise around the area where you received the shot. Some people have showed concern of cancer due to the unexpected appearance of these swollen lymph nodes. Some doctors say that it will go away by itself that it is just a secondary effect of the vaccine and if it doesn’t go away in 8 weeks to go and get it checked out. Have any of you guys presented any side effect like this with the Moderna vaccine?  I had many vaccines during my lifetime and I honestly don’t ever recall a side effect like that.,Accomplished-Board56,2021-03-13 03:02:49+00:00,8.0,0.609375,0.271875,Positive,1,m3xpk4

I called up my manager and he said he has no idea what this 7-digit reference number is and I need to call HR sometime in the week. I don't want to wait that long as they have just expanded eligibility and the appointments may all be gone by then. Can I just enter in my 5-digit clock-in number instead?

n1gvqn,"Anaphylaxis and the Vaccine I don't know if I just gave myself a panic attack but when the person brought out the list of symptoms I immediately got nervous. I was given the shot and a few moments later I immediately felt chills go up my arm and I felt light headed and dizzy and short of breath. I didnt have hives or anything and I just took deep breaths and was fine but the dizziness persisted over the next 30 minutes or so.

Because of that I think this was an amazing compassionate and selfless choice. There are so many stories circulating in these times that make me lose faith in humanity.

lk4sci,Pfizer 21f! First dose I was fine. Got it around 9:50 am. I did bleed from the shot and it bruised pretty bad.. however I didn’t feel the shot itself (flu shot hurt more). My arm was sore right after and got worse as the day went on (nothing compared to 2nd dose though). I took Tylenol a few hours after the shot and the arm pain went away completely. There was one point around 4:00 pm that day where my legs slightly felt like jello when I walked probably lasted an hour. Had no other symptoms. Just got my second dose 2 days ago around 9:45 am. Didn’t bleed this time! But my arm was sore right after about same as the first time. But by 2:00 pm my arm hurt so much I couldn’t lift it. I was actually laughing because it was so painful hahah. I ended up taking Tylenol again and it felt better. Around 9:00 pm (~12 hours after shot) arm pain came back even worse and I also had chills. I went to bed pretty early since I didn’t feel well so chills didn’t last long (less than an hour). I woke up that night about 4 times which is abnormal for me I usually sleep pretty well. Each time I woke up I had aches and could feel the arm pain. Woke up at 5:00 am and couldn’t go back to sleep. I felt weak and could barely lift my arm again. Took Tylenol around 8:00 am and felt slightly better but my arm still hurt a little. I took a 2 hour nap around 1:00 pm but at that point had no symptoms besides fatiguebeing tired also a slight headache but not bad at all. Woke up today with no arm pain and feeling completely normal! I also got about 10 hours of sleep last night. I was nervous that I would have insomnia again after reading some other posts on here.

Once all high risk and priority groups are done it will be rolled out to fit and healthy adults. As far as I’m aware there are no current plans to vaccinate children. We are also working oldest to youngest as well as those with the most high risk illnesses.

mf4exe,Pfizer second dose timing My pharmacy (Walgreens) offers the Pfizer vaccine but they will only offer the second doses after 28 days instead of the recommended 21 days. The guidance from the CDC and my dr says to get the second dose of Pfizer as close to 21 days and that the second dose COULD be administered up to 3-6 weeks in unavoidable circumstances but it’s better to stick to 3. Anyone else had their pharmacy tell them their only choice is to get the second shot at 4 weeks? I found this very strange and the pharmacy tech I spoke with kind of made it seem like they were doing it to see how far they could push back the 3-6 week guidance instead of trying to stick to the recommended 3 weeks? If they’re auto scheduling the vaccines I don’t see why they wouldn’t just auto schedule them for 3 weeks out instead of 4 if that’s the medical recommendation? I’d rather get the second dose at 3 weeks since that’s what the Prizer is recommending and wasn’t sure if this was standard practice at other pharmacies? The other non pharmacy vaccine sites are NOT doing this and going by 3 weeks but unfortunately I just can’t get to them.,Fearless_Duty_9125,2021-03-28 16:39:06+00:00,5.0,0.3616944444444444,0.0492499999999999,Positive,1,mf4exe

gjcr559,"MD here. This isn't just about the growth of traditional antivaxxers. Lets add some nuance to that statement. How can we group people according to what they think about the covid vaccine? By no means is this an exhaustive list.1. The archetype of **the Anti-Vaxxer** emotional and radical is against every single vaccine due to internet storytelling which is mostly non-scientific. This group have not suddenly expanded a lot due to covid they were always there and grow at a slow but relatively constant rate.2. **The young and un-afraid** is a person who's under 40 years of age who took a glance at mortality statistics for covid and decided that what's the point of him taking a vaccine with emergency authorization when he's not at risk for the disease it's for. He might have some concern about side effects but that's not the primary driver for why he's not getting the vaccine.3. **The medical cynical** is a person who might or might not be at risk for covid itself but due to one reason or another is very skeptical of the success rate or the side effect rate of medical interventions. Could be from previous side effects for himself among friends or relatives or a general distrust of the system. 4. **The neutral** doesn't really take a stance he just pulls up his sleeve when the time comes. If it comes. 5. **The at risk population** these are the elderly the frail and those with more comorbidities than the length of their phone number. They can simultaneously belong to any of the other groups listed here but these are the guys that stand the greatest chance to personally benefit from being vaccinated. 6. And now for the pro-vaccine segments. The first being **The young and afraid** who is a person under 40 in perfect health with a strong fear for covid despite being in the lowest risk demographic. Will go out of his or her way to get vaccinated. 7. **The Pro-vaxxer** Is as radical and emotional as the anti-vaxxer and support various authoritarian measures to get everyone vaccinated. Doesn't get as much media coverage as the 1-group but are also not helpful for the dialogue.&gt; My old boss who’s been a research scientist or director at premiere medical institutions for 15 years is Leary of the vaccine and has no science to support his claim. I just don’t get it. He's probably a 2 andor 3. My experience of medical work is that it's the failures of the system sticks with you and the longer you work the more of these you accumulate. Many of these are accidental but there's also a lot of this driven by profit and with a vaccine that have emergency authorization(that is having bypassed several normal regulatory steps) it's very easy to be skeptical. Especially if you are group 2 also. Coincidentally I'm 2 and a little bit of 3 also. &amp; x200B;&gt;  but where does this come from? General distrust of pharma and the government? Institutions lost a lot of trust government guidelines have changed numerous times same for WHO guidelines media is spreading alarmist headlines that change on a dime short term lockdowns have become year long ones. All kinds of hipfire statements that contradict the last ones are flying around and have done so all year. This expands the pool of  3. Early on  6 was a bigger pool but time and information have shifted a big amount of people over to  2. My view of things is that we don't need to ""win hearts and minds"" as if this is a military occupation campaigns. We should just vaccinate  5 first then  6 7 and if needed  4. By that point there shouldn't be a covid problem anymore but if there is then trying to convince  2 and  3 after that and by that point you'll have more side effect and safety surveillance data to use as fodder. Engaging people in verbal fights because they use their medicalbodily autonomy in a way you find misguided will only lead to people digging in their positions.",vivehelpme,2021-01-15 15:57:52+00:00,,0.4388957307060755,0.0900184729064039,Positive,kxco7g,kxco7g

gnz7et7,HiThere are gaps between reality the scientific consensus and medical technology. This creates problems when scientific consensus and public health policies are being created simultaneously. The current widely available covid immunity tests only reflect a fraction of the immunity that you acquire from the infection. The vaccine creates a stereotyped response that only targets the fraction that is currently tested giving the illusion that it protects more than the infection response while the infection itself has an evolutionary pattern that fluctuates (see reference). This is why in my opinion it would not be scientific or humane to force people who were infected to have the vaccine at least until more reliable immunity tests are widely available.But to answer your question: We don’t know yet!Reference,EarthVisitorToo,2021-02-19 05:41:37+00:00,,0.4972222222222223,0.075,Positive,ln2skt,ln2skt

That helped and within about an hour or two all my symptoms got better.  I still felt a little achy but my fever went away.

gszng3k,I see I wouldn’t sweat it. This is totally IMO based on my education... Turmeric is an excellent anti-inflammatory drug but it cannot suppress the acquired division of the immune system much. What I’m trying to say is for the vaccine to be effective the goal is to create antibodies. Turmeric can’t prevent that if that was the case turmeric would be a cure to a lot of auto-immune diseases! It can however help you fight off the nasty side effects (painnauseafever). I mean unless you found some ultra concentrated turmeric that also has an extremely high half life (most of the turmeric you ingest doesn’t last long enough in your system to do such damage),dO11u,2021-04-01 03:05:51+00:00,,0.5469871794871796,0.0831410256410256,Positive,gszlydw,mhg30g

I had been meaning to get it for the past couple of years but never got around to it so I just said “sure go ahead”. Later in the week my partner had been scheduled for a COVID vaccine and they had a spot open up so I was offered the vaccination and we could just get it together. I hadn’t realized co-administration of the COVID vaccine hadn’t been thoroughly researched so it’s not encouraged and I went ahead and said yes. After the fact I saw the guidelines discouraging co-administration of the COVID vaccine within 14 days of any other vaccine but the CDC doesn’t recommend re-doing either vaccinations.

You will see in the upcoming years how censorship will change the way even if you can communicate with family members and loved ones.

gj0vmq7,Viruses medications and vaccines totally can impact your menstrual cycle! They can cause physical stress on your body or change the balance of hormones. As you correctly understand stress can impact your cycle. :)I was simply asking if others had that experience. And it looks like one or two have. Impacting menstrual cycle is an entirely different discussion from impacting your long term fertility. I’m sure this is an important issue to you but it’s very clearly not what I’m talking about. No big deal - just better to not conflate two totally different issues. That’s the type of thing that confuses people!,cootercanoe42,2021-01-12 18:17:49+00:00,,0.5697685185185185,0.14875,Positive,gj0k9dc,kvlxwy
gql7o2a,Good question. Thanks for having an open mind. My warning is genuine. You have nothing to gain and everything to lose from taking one of these 'vaccines'...even the mainstream media are telling you that it will not prevent you from getting Covid nor spreading it. They claim it only makes symptoms milder which if true is not enough to put this demonic concoction in your body.Okay here are some official studies that the mainstream media will never tell you about:The best deterrent I can suggest is to go directly to VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). You have to do a bit of navigating to get to the list which is intentional since it's a government site and they have invested in vaccines but there are endless injuries and deaths recorded from these vaccines.I wouldn't personally take any vaccine but this improperly untested genetic modifying technology is nothing short of evil. Remember that vaccine companies like Pfizer have paid out millions in reparations to families and governments for past crimes. They don't care about human lives. I urge you not to take it and anyway even when Covid was around the survival rate was 99.8% for anyone under 70. It's not worth the risk and the risk is great.It goes a lot deeper than what I'm saying but I don't want to overwhelm you with potentially paradigm changing information. You know where I am if you want to know more.I hope you make the right decision.,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-11 16:41:38+00:00,,0.4992063492063492,0.0839285714285714,Positive,gqkdasn,m2l8kp

m4booq,One Week after the first dose. A few side effects. I got my first shot of Pfizer on Sunday (37) so it's almost a week now and figured I'd share my experience. I'm Female 40 no current medical issues and got offered to be vaccinated when I dragged my mom to her appointment. They had extras I think so registered me on the spot.The shot itself was painless. I was actually worried for a second because I thought it would hurt a bit like the flu shot. 5 - 10 minutes later I got this odd metallic taste in my mouth. My mom also complained of it. I had some shortness of breath driving us home but I'm not sure if that was the vaccine or my pollen allergy acting up because it's in the air at the moment and we did have to walk a bit to get to the car. An anti-histamine tablet took care of that and I didn't experience it again so I'm thinking allergies.Wasn't feeling tired but must have been because I slept for close to 12 hours that day. Pain like an old bruise on the site of the injection that I'd be reminded of when I moved my arm or rolled on it while sleeping. Next day metallic taste still lingering and upsetting my stomach a little. Not as bad as day one and not enough to really be an issue. Injection site way better today.Day three. Injection site pain and metallic taste gone. Was fine enough to do the groceries. started to have some pain in my side after my afternoon nap and thought I strained the muscle while I was sleeping. Day 4. Nope muscle pain. Ow my leg hurts! My side hurts and why does my other shoulder hurt the injection was on the other side. Ow! Do I have a blood clot! Nope it's muscular. Walking hurts but voltarn gel and some heat packs really helped. Day 5 till now. I have odd muscle aches with my right leg being the worst. The muscles are stiff like a charley horse but I can get around. Scared me for a bit but thankfully it's getting better. That was my experience. I thought I got away with mild symptoms before the muscle cramps hit. It's painful but not too bad more like the day after a hard workout when I haven't been to the gym for awhile.,Kidlike101,2021-03-13 18:06:26+00:00,0.0,0.3856371252204586,-0.0572606646825396,Negative,1,m4booq

l022cz,7 days post Moderna 1st dose. Just wanted to share my experience for others looking for info.  Got my first does last Monday 111.        Arm soreness a few hours later  but nothing else to speak of.  Worked out that evening (air bike).    2nd day  arm still sore  maybe really minor fatigue.    Late in the day my arm stopped feeling as sore.     Next few days:  Generally feel okay  maybe a bit more tired.  I am doing my normal workouts (lifting weights and air bike in the evening) but feel a little weaker and way more wiped out after.    Every so often feel a bit more anxious.   Hard to describe just a a real slight feeling of being nervous.       6th day:  Felt fine all day  had a good workout and didn't feel overly tired after.    However at night I started having this really low level nausea.  I felt uncomfortable all night tossing an turning and just didn't sleep well.    Low level nausea lasted into this morning (7th day)  slight headache  just feel a bit under the weather  but the nausea has since gone.   Now have a bit of that anxious feeling back  but overall feel pretty fine.   So that's it so far.   Will update if anything changes in the next few days.,WackyArmInflatable,2021-01-18 19:43:09+00:00,2.0,0.4202380952380952,0.0196428571428571,Positive,1,l022cz
ky0aw5,Just got Pfizer dose 1! (18F) Just drove through and got the first dose! Scheduled Feb. 5th for my second. I get pretty bad anxiety with needles and was damn near hyperventilating while driving up to the tent but the injection itself was the least painful shot I’ve ever got. Literally didn’t feel anything so if you’re also afraid of needles the initial injection is the least of your worries.After the injection they had us drive over to a little parking lot near first responders for about 20 minutes incase there were any allergic reactions. It’s been over an hour since I got the shot and I feel fine. I don’t have any soreness no fatigue etc. Then again it is early. Felt a little lightheaded immediately afterwards because of the anxiety of it all (literally every time I deal with needles) but I was able to drive home fine.Tips if you have a fear of needles:-Eat something before your appointment! I lose all appetite when I’m anxious but I feel 10x worse on an empty stomach. Even if you don’t think you can keep it down try and eat a little something. Also make sure to hydrate yourself.-Move around beforehand get your nerves out. Since it was a drive through (and very crowded) you’ll obviously not be able to move around like you want to so do it when you can.-Bring something for comfort. I wore a fluffy jacket and when it was time to get the injection I put it across my lap and held it until I was finished.-Listen to some music. Whether it’s your favorite song a slow song an upbeat song etc. Listen to something to distract you just enough that you aren’t focused on the shot itself.-and ofc don’t look at it. Why you’d subject yourself to that I have no idea. Just look away. Get it in your non-dominant arm since you’ll be less likely to notice the soreness when it comes.We’re in phase 1B here in Texas so being fat finally got me something. I haven’t seen many other teensyoung adults post about their vaccine experience on Reddit so I thought I’d post updates every so often. I guess for a little background health info:I’m morbidly obese (about 310lbs 5’6) I don’t have any underlying health issues not on any medication no food or medicine allergies. I’m about as healthy as it gets for a fat person my age. When dealing with vaccines my arm swells just about every time so I’m sure this time won’t be different. I got my college shots in Feb. 2020 and was sent home two days later with a fever and chills that subsided the same day. Again I’m sure this time won’t be different but we’ll see. Anything is better than COVID.Overall I’m really happy I was able to get the vaccine. I was so tempted to just not show up today out of fear and worrying around it but I did it and I feel proud of myself. My younger siblings are all anti-vax. They’ll get vaccinations if they’re mandatory but never willingly so this one was an immediate no for them. (all asthmatics too...anyway) If you’re a teenGen Z and have received your vaccination please let me know how it went! I saw a few people say that the younger you are the more likely you are to experience the side effects? Idk how founded this is but if you have any info please lmk.,moirati,2021-01-15 18:16:26+00:00,3.0,0.5285639412997905,0.0496986373165618,Positive,1,ky0aw5

m18aip,Took a Meloxicam before getting 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine HELP! Not sure if there's anyone here with solid knowledge about this but I recently got back surgery and have been taking 7.5mg Meloxicam once a day to deal with the aches and pains. I absentmindedly took one at 7AM the day of my vaccination which was at 3:45PM that same day. Should I be concerned that I messed with the effectiveness of the vaccine? It seems that it may only cause an issue if an NSAID is taken at the same time the vaccine is administered not before. My arm was a little sore about an hour after receiving the vaccine and I did feel a little tired so I'm assuming my body was developing the intended immune response and I probably have nothing to worry about.,_lowtempdabs_,2021-03-09 15:06:29+00:00,3.0,0.4188888888888889,-0.1025,Negative,1,m18aip

gr023q7,As someone who may be having more of the extreme reactions to the Moderna vaccine I still encourage your to get it. My symptoms are still likely temporary. It's nice to not have to worry about COVID anymore. If concerned maybe go with the more 'old school' vaccine like J&amp;J also avoids the second dose issue. Everyone else I know has had a normal course of recovery. While I am trending toward believing my symptoms maybe vaccine related it's still not certain either. I only have posted here to find comfort in learning there may be some people with similar symptoms and so we could maybe learn from each other what does and doesn't work for improving our recovery.,astroguyfornm,2021-03-15 11:16:38+00:00,,0.5843406593406594,0.1148351648351648,Positive,m4pyv2,m4pyv2

gqb1md4,"&gt;They have been lying about pandemics for decades. What makes you think this one would be any different? because they've NOT been lying for even longer. because they've been truthful for a good chunk of the time medicine has been around. because they're scientist and researchers and doctors because of the hippocratic oath and tons of other reason. just because you've caught the 1% lying doesn't automatically all the others are. but the main reason is YOU HAVE ZERO SOURCE TO BACK YOUR STATEMENT. that's why ;)   &gt;You forgot to capitalize *'No'. in fact i didn't capitalize a lot of things they're it's still not fundamentally wrong as opposed to the many errors you made. but then again i'm not harping on those i'm just showing you why labelling yourself as smart isn't true. All four countries run by the bankers and oligarchs all four countries with motives. once again zero source. you can't even name the country let alone their sponsors. don't bother going into the motives of the sponsors. i said at least 4 not 4 and you just swallowed it whole like the good sheep you are without even checking. it's amazing how those four countries you mentioned can come from the same place huh ?

Here's your answer: *the patients who died were already sick and frail and likely to die with or without the vaccine*. it's already written do you copy and paste without reading?   &gt;You morons who take the vaccine will start dropped dead next flu season or at least deal with a superflu that can kill you. Because the covid vaccine will destroy your immune system. you have ABSOLUTELY no idea how vaccines work do you?

Even if they weren’t technically locked down in the summer the citizens doing their part played a large part.Most other countries aren’t still dealing with the pandemic like the US is it’s not like China is the only country no longer suffering.

m6ekoi,Pfizer dose one - 312 Hey guys. I went to get it first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday. The nurse did an excellent job administering the shot (I HATE needles). It was quick and just a little pinch of pain for a second. The nurse told me I could take Motrin or Tylenol later if I had pain but not ibuprofen or any other blood thinning medication. My arm was sore but I just kept moving it throughout the day even while driving! I did yoga focusing on arms that evening. I woke up with some arm pain the next morning but it actually was a bit better than the evening before. By day 3 no arm pain at all. No other symptoms for me. I didn’t take anything after either. I feel great! Went for a hike Saturday and did yoga again. No issues. I think the key is really to keep moving your arm so it doesn’t get a chance to get sore. But everyone is different!

Also if you google it the FDA and big pharma companies will claim that it’s not safe but they all lack any evidence (AT ALL) to actually back it up. If they talk about the blue man well it’s way out of context because he was drinking gallons of it a day and was drinking silver nitrate which is different than pure colloidal silver. There’s actual  evidence to prove it’s effectiveness and that it is safe for human consumption.,Popular-Position-119,2020-12-14 04:55:40+00:00,,0.4277777777777776,0.2456632653061224,Positive,k0din5,k0din5

gsnmnct,Whichever vaccine you can get the soonest. The sooner you can start building protection the better. I would not be worried about the efficacy rates between the Pfizer and Moderna vs. the Janssen vaccine. All of them do their job effectively and seems to protect against severe hospitalization and death against covid. Just remember that the human trials with Phizer and Moderna took place in the summer when there were not as many cases or as many variants prevalent. The Janssen vaccine trials took place in multiple countries later in 2020 when there were variants running rampant and significantly more covid cases. If you do have the chance to get the Janssen vaccine go for it. It is 1 dose and you'll be building immunity sooner than waiting for a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. &amp; x200B;I was able to get vaccinated on Friday and took whatever vaccine the clinic had available which happened to be the Moderna but I would have gladly have taken the Janssen vaccine. They all work the same. You getting vaccinated may help convince your parents to also get vaccinated I have seen several others take this route and have their parents get vaccinated after they realized their kin was fine.,SpudofIdaho,2021-03-29 04:53:59+00:00,,0.3964285714285714,0.3154761904761905,Positive,gsnju67,mfg2t0

l682ae,"Thoughts on Covid vaccine line-cutting (cross-post w rcovid19vaccinerats)  Hi allPosting this under a throwaway account since it's a bit more controversial than my typical posts.What do people think ethically and morally about the actions of those who find ways to obtain a vaccine prior to their eligibility as defined by their state? I've been thinking about it a lot since I was offered a vaccination spot at a clinic this week by a friend but declined due to my not being part of the state's current priority groups (I'm in my 30's work from home etc.) A few of my friends in similar demographics chose to go through with it and will be getting their shots. Just to clarify: these spots at the clinic were obtained by registering through the state; these are not ""end-of-the-day"" doses that would otherwise be thrown away.On the one hand I think obviously that the elderly and essential workers who need to show up in-person to their jobs should be vaccinated before me. On the other hand does the ""market"" (in this case our highly dysfunctional national vaccine rollout) function more efficiently when people act out of self-interest? I.e. should people just take any avenue available to them to get vaccinated and this will lead in the longterm to the highest uptake of the vaccine?I really don't think anybody who wants the shot is ""wrong"" for wanting it. There are many ways to rank ""priority"" that are difficult to standardize across society. In the end my decision to forgo the vaccine speaks to my opinion on how people ""should"" act in this situation. I'll be first in line once I'm deemed ""eligible"" to receive a shot. But I just find this to be a fascinating moral and ethical dilemma that I wanted to open it up to others to speak their minds openly. Or maybe I'm just trying to justify the selfish actions of my friends as something other than what they are.",vaccine_q_throwaway,2021-01-27 16:22:40+00:00,14.0,0.4899444444444444,0.0439444444444444,Positive,1,l682ae

gst47hk,I believe a lot of people feel that way it's a common side effect.  It's just the vaccine working.  Your body's immune system is mounting a response to your own cells.  When they injected you with the experimental gene therapy it made your immune system recognize your own cells as a foreign infection.  So your body is currently attacking itself.  This is completely normal and by design.You likely will have chronic bouts with illness for the remainder of your life due to your immune system being compromised by the autoimmune disease you've signed up for to avoid getting COVID symptoms which ironically will make you more susceptible to getting it in the first place.

gpontks,First of all congrats! I am assuming it is your first dose? It will take 2-3 weeks for it to have any appreciable effect and it won't be as good as after your second dose. If it is your second dose then still wait 2-4 weeks for full effect. The answer no matter what is that there is always a chance but it is greatly reduced if you follow my previous advice. Look out for research papers from Israel since they are the best case of studying Pfizer cases but it appears to reduce transmission significantly but I wouldn't do anything risky until the other person is vaccinated and they waited enough time.,LotusElise,2021-03-04 19:03:12+00:00,,0.3986111111111111,0.2913194444444444,Positive,lxq3ix,lxq3ix

m5fcj4,China is not using an mRNA vaccine. They are using a traditional vaccine... mRNA vaccines have never been approved for use in humans. Traditional vaccines usually are tested for 2-3 years before they are released to the public. The mRNA vaccine uses messenger RNA to send code to your cells to produce covid spike proteins with no off switch meaning your cells will continue to produce auto immune reactions which through previous studies (part of the reason they haven’t been previously approved) have caused over production of immune system response sending your body into shock and causing death (seen through tests in animals from previous studies). Which means if there is another form of covid later there is a chance it could trigger a deadly reaction in people with the mRNA injection. Also Modern a has NEVER been approved to release any treatment for anything before this.China (where the virus supposedly originated from) is not using an mRNA vaccine! They are successfully using a traditional vaccine called coronaVAC. Why is this?? Why aren’t we using a traditional vaccine instead of testing a brand new non tested “vaccine” on humans? Professor Luo Dahai of Nanyang University even states “mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine and there is no successful example of them being used in the population....

m1rzvi,Can’t decide on the vaccine (Opinions?) So I work in long-term care with older adults and came down with COVID in mid-December when our facility got it. I had the mildest symptoms and even worked on the COVID unit while I had it. I have a  unique runny nose that I’ll call a “battery acid” runny nose I lost my tastesmell for about 4 days and had mild muscle aches. Since I had it during the first vaccine role out that we received I declined it since I was already immune. It’s been around the “90 day” mark where some say you’re able to get it again but is it worth it? I was offered it another time last month and was on edge but ultimately decided not to get it. 1. Does my immunity really end after 90 days?   -In addition to that I was exposed around 3 weeks ago and had the same unique “battery acid” runny nose” for about half a day so maybe that kicked the antibodies bad into gear?2. Some of my coworkers who had COVID previously with little to no symptoms experienced intense side effects with the vaccine so I could experience the same.3. On the other end I could see a future where proof of vaccination is required for some things like concerts major events air travel etc. So that may be a reason to get it.4. All of the older patients I work for have been vaccinated so they won’t be able to get it if I hypothetically got COVID again. So I’m looking for opinions on if I should even get the vaccine considering if I even could get it again I’d have  mild symptoms while if I did get the vaccine I could have some pretty major side effects. Thanks for reading your opinions are valued greatly!,zZedLeppelin,2021-03-10 07:20:56+00:00,6.0,0.495734126984127,0.1633432539682539,Positive,1,m1rzvi

kw75hv,"Anybody experience ""brain fog"" as a side effect of the vaccine (specifically Pfizer)? Hi all.  My wife had the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine just over 24 hours ago.  Earlier today (about 18 hours after the injection) she started feeling what she described as disconnected slow and forgetful.  She can't really hold a thought or conversation and loses her train of thought easily.  She just wants to sit and do nothing. She is a mental health counselor and had to cancel her sessions today because she couldn't focus at all.  I think it sounds similar to what people describe as the brain fog with covid.It's only been about a half a day now but I'm just wondering if it would make sense that this could be a side-effect of the vaccine?  I hear it talked about as a side-effect of Covid itself so does that mean it could also be a side effect of the the vaccine?

gj8hscp,Hi! I am also a nurse (mental health) and I got my first dose of Pfizer yesterday at 0900. I had a very mild case of Covid in November. I feel exactly like I did when I had Covid. Fatigued headache my face even feels swollen and painful like a sinus infection terrible insomnia last night and when I did sleep I had weird dreams. I didn’t have muscle aches when I had Covid but the muscle aches I have now are killer. I took Tylenol and now I’m laying in bed. Crossing my fingers I feel good enough to work tomorrow.

I’ve tried calling 111 but it’s saying their lines are too busy. She seems to be trying to get some rest now but obviously I’m still concerned.

mf1vk1,My reaction to the first vaccine Hello all just going to go ahead and share my experience after the first Pfizer vaccine to help those who could potentially experience the same side-effects.I caught covid early last year after a trip to the UK. It wiped me out for a while and really took a toll on me. I received the first Pfizer shot this Friday at 2:00 pm. I drove home and felt fine for a while but at around 9:00 Pm I noticed I felt a bit clammy and feverish. I went to bed at around 11:00 not feeling great. I woke up at 6:00 am and felt awful. I honestly felt like I had the flu or early covid: headache fever muscle pains sore throat slight runny nose. I felt this way all day and was pretty concerned because they never tell you sore throat and a runny nose are potential side effects. I started playing video games late that evening to take myMind off how I was feeling and at around 9PM I noticed my fever had broke and I wasn’t feeling as bad. Went to bed at 10 PM and woke up this morning feeling 100%.Hope my story puts someone who potentially goes through a similar situation as mine at ease.,FloridaManatlarge,2021-03-28 14:33:23+00:00,5.0,0.5416666666666666,0.0452380952380952,Positive,1,mf1vk1

ggmzuer,Hi I just blocked that user. He used a racial slur as well. I’m glad you posted your result. I’m a retired RN not quite old enough for the old folks group.  So unlikely to get it in near future. Someone needs to point out that injections perhaps with small amounts of insulin being the exception involve a large amount of liquid semi viscous in this case and it displaces tissue. It’s going to be sore. I think tetanus was the worst for me because it was a high volume and thick to boot. What I find intriguing is that none of the injectors seem to Z track the injection. I always used that especially for irritating meds like Demerol. Also I find a bit of heat applied helps it disburse faster as does moving the injected muscle. I’ve given hundreds of flu shots at the drug store and not a single person ever complained that it hurt. What hurts if you want to talk about pain is lip fillers.

They watched me after for 30 min because I have a few allergies (anaphylactic). If you have a reaction to the first dose make sure to document it and talk to your provider about premeditating if you are considering it.

gwgyspl,I was feeling anxious too about the second shot and I have been having issues with panic due to other health issues lately. So here are some things that helped me hope it might help you!If you know of anyone or heard any stories of positive experiences try to remind yourself of those being real too. I find with my anxiety the uncertainty of a negative thing makes me focus on it and that makes it worse. So whenever I worried about how the second shot would be I would tell myself it might not be as bad as I worry about. I reminded myself of people I knew personally who had no effects and of those who had symptoms only for a day and then were fine. Just try to find a way to counter the anxious thought with another thought. If you don’t know anyone who had no effects then you can take me as an example after my second Pfizer shot I only had a sore arm (and was very hungry the next day but not sure that’s an actual thing). I also took anti anxiety medication before my shot because needles give me extreme anxiety anyways. So if it’s really bad for you maybe that would help too. If you don’t have medication bananas can have a natural calming effect you can try to eat one a half hour before.I also tried to do things within my control like making sure to be well hydrated the day before and day of. I went to a state park and spent time in nature the day before had soothing broth with garlic and took vitamins. I also reminded myself that feeling anxiety was ok and having that discomfort would not last forever.You can also let the person giving you the shot know you’re anxious I read some people can then lie down so they don’t feel faint. If you go with someone and can hold their hand that helped me too.Hope you can find something that helps you!,meilimeile,2021-04-30 21:10:24+00:00,,0.5008996212121213,-0.0836963383838383,Negative,n1ql6q,n1ql6q

No unpleasant side effects at all - mild soreness up and down my arm but it’s so mild I wouldn’t even call it pain.  I felt lightheaded immediately after getting it and thought it was probably my shot anxiety.  But it’s continued to get worse so I know it must be a side effect.  But it’s not troubling or problematic.  I just feel a little “floaty.”But in the past half hour or so I’ve started to feel like everything is really funny.

Why didn't they work on helping people's immune systems by shutting junk food outlets tobacconists alcohol sellers...basically the places that were allowed to stay open!!!? You don't know evil you don't understand psychopathy and you certainly have done no research if you trust corrupt agencies like the WHO CDC psychopaths like Gates and Fauci and the various vaccine companies who from their history clearly have a sinister agenda which doesn't include benefiting the average person.I have empathy for people who suffered from getting the original laboratory modified disease the elite released but it wasn't enough to warrant the destruction of society that followed or a military industrial complex bio-weapon 'vaccine' that is now causing more sorrow and death. That was all done because people are stupid enough to believe that governments tell the truth and are so effete that they are willing to surrender all their remaining freedoms for false security. Same old easily manipulable and maleable human beings who the ruling class can use the same psychological techniques on through history.The vaccines which are not vaccines are rubbish....dangerous in fact. If Covid subsides it's not because of that but it won't stop because they need to keep this STUPID narrative going while they reshape reality bring in vaccine passports which are tantamount to the Chinese social Credit system shut down external life while they have people used to staying in their bubbles and bring in the rest of their biometric bio-security eco-fascist system.You obviously have little clue about your world and ignore what the people in power tell you is going to happen. you should listen to people who DO research that and would have told you 10 years ago that this virus nonsense was coming.,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-31 16:09:42+00:00,,0.50748556998557,-0.0413194444444444,Negative,gsv4mg5,mgjh04

gi0srin,&gt;There may be a very small chance of one. There are also autoimmune reactions to the virus and there have been dozens you may have missed because they're also rare relative to the number of cases and deaths.Here is my main worry: the side effects of this vaccine seem to correlate with the effects of COVID. The main side effect that I'm worried about is that if there is an immune response wherever there is an ACE2 protein (I am not a biologist but this is according to what I have read) and if the brain expresses this protein then there may be inflammation in the brain.The main effect set of COVID I fear is the neurological and I fear that if I take this vaccine that it can cause neurological damage on par with what COVID causes. Chronic brain inflammation is also linked to depression anxiety and many other psychological maladies. I did read an article that mentions how neurological effects are correlated with severity of illness but even then COVID still causes neurological damage regardless of severity ([ and the vaccine's severity is relatively low but we know so little about the brain and have such poor insight when it's damaged that it seems like a very high risk from my perspective.I'm afraid of both COVID and this vaccine. Is there any credence to my fears regarding neurological damage caused by the vaccine? I understand no studies have really been done about it but maybe the effect simply hasn't been revealed yet.,swampshark19,2021-01-04 01:50:28+00:00,,0.4384789915966386,0.0041470588235294,Positive,gi0q6gp,ko7n69

gow4fev,I would 100% listen to your folks and accept there choice the vaccine has not been ruled out long enough. They have specific data and still growing with no long term effects on there health. As a frontline worker I accept your parents choice. This vaccine reduces there immune system and creates a more pathology pathway for the bugs like I said science can sometimes be wrong. Give maybe 2 years for your parents to read there data and see the outcome later. If you love your parents you would respect there wishes. Not your values and opinion. Yes it’s to keep people safe I have on the other hand not seen this. But people watch the news and I work on the frontline. So it’s all about research and data.

gof0117,I can definitely understand the hesitation. I'm a healthy 31 year old though I do work with kids with disabilities and decided to get the vaccine even though I'm working from home at the moment. What helped me is remembering that COVID also has long term side effects for many people some of which can be life threatening disabilities (see: healthy 25 year old requiring double lung transplant and healthy 30 year olds dropping dead from blood clots). They were also unaware for several years after Zika virus that unborn babies ended up with microsyphaly or that contracting the Measles wipes out your immunization history. Either way you can potentially lose but at least with the immunization you're less likely to put those at risk who won't be able to take the vaccine at all.As awful as it is the reason why I trust it is because the most narcissistic money grabbing asshole capitalist millionaires and politicians got it. An insane amount of money got thrown at this and God knows the 1% and politicians would never put themselves in danger if they didn't think it was safe.,Calligrapher_Worth,2021-02-23 02:42:40+00:00,,0.4900793650793651,0.0468253968253968,Positive,lq14qq,lq14qq

My dentist got the vaccine and then came and gave me a filling right after so I know it doesn’t always mean you get sick. What I’m worried about is that one of my mothers close friends is a nurse and she received the vaccine as well and then started shaking.

lanqvo,vaccine side effects or Covid? Hi guys so I received my first dose of Moderna on Saturday Jan 30th (2.5 days ago) and the first day I had arm soreness and a bit of fatigue but starting today I’ve been having nasal congestion (stuffy nose) and a mild sinus headache. I haven’t seen nasal congestion as a vaccine side effect so i’m concerned I may have contracted covid in the waiting room to get the vaccine (as I’ve been off work for the past 2ish weeks and haven’t done anything else). I’m 19 years old female and I was wearing a double mask while in the clinic however the wait was over 2 hours and there were 20+ people in there. I’m going for a Covid test tomorrow to be sure but I’m wondering if anyone has heard of nasal congestion or stuffy nose being a side effect from the vaccine? Really hoping it’s not covid!UPDATE Tuesday 22: Negative for Covid still have sinus pressure not severe,lilcollegekid,2021-02-02 04:48:46+00:00,6.0,0.3065656565656565,0.0984848484848484,Positive,1,lanqvo

mggf00,Extreme vomiting after Pfizer Hi. Wondering if anyone else experienced what I did from my research only 2% of Pfizer vaccines caused vomiting or nausea. I had shot one at 1:30 PM (13:30 pm) and by 4 am the next morning I was violently vomiting. Vomited my dinner the night before and then just water and bile from 4-10 am. I felt absolutely awful. Dizzy. Couldn’t close my eyes or else the room was spinning. When I ate my dinner I notified immediately that my stomach felt odd. Something I don’t usually feel. Then the next morning was just absolutely rough. I’m terrified to get the second shot now as mostly everyone I know hasn’t experienced much during the first...,gaveupbuttrying,2021-03-30 13:47:10+00:00,12.0,0.5155555555555557,0.0072222222222222,Positive,1,mggf00

m6bwod,Anaphylaxis and Seizures Hi I'm a 27 year old poor American. I have no pre-existing conditions. I got the first Moderna vaccine on 311 and had the worst reaction possible. I had anaphylaxis and 1 - 2 seizures during that time. It ended with a trip to the ER and expensive follow-up visits to make sure my brain wasn't irreparably damaged. Now I'm about to start drowning in medical debt. That's in addition to my newfound panic attacks every time I fall asleep and the depression that comes with knowing I could lose my house and everything I have for no good reason.THERE IS NO COMPENSATION AVAILABLE.

gnthqe5,Shoot hang in. It does pass. Tbh I’m still not 100% but the worst was over after 3-4 days. Your at day two if you run a similar course to me you should start turning the corner. Odd though thurs after my shot I was much better then Friday out of the blue the vertigo reappeared for a short time. I don’t know if you are on any supplements beats ginger etc if you are I’d recommend you stop for a while. For some reason they may have aggravated my symptoms I can’t be sure but when I stopped them it seemed to help. Might just have been the timing. It certainly isn’t fun but when you know it has an end it’s a bit more bearable and I assure you it has an end. Glad you are saying only a bit a vertigo cause tbh it was horrible for me my first shot it lasted 18 hrs second it was days non stop.

gss6894,I got the flu shot a few months ago but my husband decided to pass on it. We both got the Pfizer vaccine one week ago and had the exact same side effects (super sore arm fatigue brain fog). I’ve had very mild headaches the last couple days. I never get headaches so this was a surprise side effect. My husband hasn’t had any issues like that. All in all I don’t think having the flu shot will have any effect on your vaccine experience. I was just told today however that if you drink as much water and electrolytes as you can possibly stand before getting the vaccine it reduces the side effects. I’m not a medical professional so try it at your own risk. But if you’re worried about side effects perhaps give that a try.,tinyspacebee,2021-03-30 09:04:24+00:00,,0.378030303030303,0.156060606060606,Positive,mg6int,mg6int

mfbziz,My university is mandating the vaccine - What is the real tie between mRNA Covid Vaccine and female infertility? My public university updated its mandatory vaccination policy to include the covid vaccine. I would transfer if it wasn’t my last semester and will have completed 135150 credits. But I can’t just drop out of school and be jobless with 100k in student debt over not finishing semester. My main fear is fertility - what are the true ties to mRNA technology and fertility?

I saw 12 people got pregnant with Pzifer and I’ve read tons of Reddit posts of people asking similar questions but many of them were from a couple months ago.

gl4ju7l,Okay firstly thank you so much for the help! CLEARLY you’re doing gods work by essentially saying “You didn’t do your research because I obviously did and haha look how good I am because I didn’t get the vaccine pay me attention!”. Go you I hope you feel good about yourself thank you for enlightening me. Secondly unless you make vaccines you know just as much as the rest of us. Everyone is in the dark to a point none of us know with 100% certainty what will happen with the vaccines yet. We all have access to the internet and the same information to go and research and make choices about what to do with our own bodies after reading it. Unless you’re about to tell me you’re a vaccine maker or a scientist (which I am guessing you’re not because you wouldn’t come to the comments to be an arsehole) you’re no more qualified to make a decision about the vaccine than I am. If you have read the information available and decided it’s not for you then BRILLIANT. Personally after reading as many articles and journals as I could I decided I’d rather take my chances with the vaccine than with COVID. As someone who works with deceased and their families I have seen the effects of COVID first hand and I’d much rather feel like hell for a few days now than risk the chance of this virus putting me in a box before my time.This post was clearly not for people with your opinion it was clearly aimed at others who have had the vaccine.,Mrsmoopiethethird,2021-01-28 18:21:16+00:00,,0.3976666666666666,0.2269999999999999,Positive,gl4cyvp,l6qn4n

m45mkb,"Actual evidence of safety for breastfeeding? My wife (29) is a teacher and received her first dose of Moderna in February. She is also nursing our 6mo daughter (which btw requires so much strength and dedication to do while also being such a fantastic teacher!).Right before her second dose Providence Cancer Institute released a study on breast milk after covid vaccination which basically found much-higher-than-expected levels of IgG (an immunoglobulin) in the milk specifically after the second shot. It freaked her out because - even though IgG is a good thing for the baby - it indicated that they weren't REALLY sure what's actually in vaccinated breast milk.She ended up cancelling her second jab but wants to reschedule again when she's done a little more research.There's lots of quotes online about how they're really sure breastfeeding is safe after vaccination but none of them really present any evidence for that besides a cursory ""we're sure nothing harmful ends up in the milk"" for the nonscientific population. We're not at all unwilling to trust health authorities but especially with how political the vaccine has gotten we'd appreciate a scientific - we were both researchers at one point or another in our academic careers - explanation for how they are so sure especially with this brand new immune tech.Can anyone provide some insight into this or point us to a source with actual research on the safeness of this technology (even something that came out before covid but demonstrates an understanding about some of the vaccine's underpinning tech from prior research)?Again we're not unscientific or anti-vax we just want to hear it from research rather than a talking head.Thanks!TL;DR: Looking for research on the safety of the Moderna covid vaccine or its components for breastfeeding.",MrOberann,2021-03-13 12:47:02+00:00,5.0,0.4055167055167055,0.1807255244755244,Positive,1,m45mkb

With ""Severe"" meaning that you aren't able to do daily activities (aka go to work) when marked with (a) and requires at least intravenous hydration when marked with (b).So with the first dose you will have about a 2 to 3% chance of having severe reaction and a 27% chance that you experience pain that requires you to take pain medication. The second dose is much more brutal with 5 to 10% for sever reactions and 45% requiring pain medication.It has a 10 to 20 times higher rate of adverse events than established vaccinations that did go through the required studies like the Tetanus or Hepatitis vaccine.

You will have to be diligent in finding a provider with capacity to serve 1Bs. Call around! Subscribe to the state or county health department's twitter feeds. Turn on your notifications! They will tweet when new providers come online. Then sign up IMMEDIATELY. Once you get an email confirmation  you are set regardless of what other email you may receive from the provider.

goihpot,Congrats on your vaccination.  Given the way things are right now totally understand that you wouldn't want anything to make that vaccine less effective.  And take heart studies from Israel (where 23 of the population are vaccinated) indicate that the vaccine is more than 90% effective - even against the UK COVID strain that will likely become the dominant strain by March.Echoing  uMakeupaddict0088 both of the approved vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA vaccines.  Basically the vaccines use mRNA to cell-jack your cells and trick them into producing certain COVID-19 proteins (but not the virus itself) which causes your body's defense system to kick in.  This is amazing technology.  But it's also the faberge egg of vaccines.  The mRNA needs to be protected in a sheet of lipid nanoparticles to make it to the cell.  But both the mRNA and the lipid nanoparticles are unstable and therefore must be kept frozen before they are injected. If you want to learn more about this I made a video on the topic: [  But don't worry the freezing requirements are only an issue when the vaccines are handled.  Keep in mind that once injected the vaccines are subjected to your body's temperature of around 98 degrees.  In fact to keep them frozen in your body you would have to be dead - which pretty much defeats the point now doesn't it?  So your hot shower won't make much of a difference.Anyway the CDC puts out guidance on what you should or shouldn't do with the vaccine: [  Taking showers of any kind is not discussed in that guidance.,COVID_VacciNATION,2021-02-23 22:01:36+00:00,,0.6828320802005012,0.1543859649122807,Positive,lqq22e,lqq22e

gjgqluu,While the studies did not call for pregnant women to participate there were people in the trials who became pregnant after taking the vaccine. There were no adverse events seen in pregnant women who took the vaccine during the trial and many pregnant women have taken the vaccines now that they are approved. So far we haven't seen any problems!    45% of the Pfizer trial participants were 56-85 years old so that's almost half of them! For Moderna over 7000 Americans over the age of 65 were included in the study. You can see some of the breakdown in their news release:&gt; includes more than 7000 Americans over the age of 65. It also includes more than 5000 Americans who are under the age of 65 but have high-risk chronic diseases that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 such as diabetes severe obesity and cardiac disease. These medically high-risk groups represent 42% of the total participants in the Phase 3 COVE study. The study also included communities that have historically been under-represented in clinical research and have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The study includes more than 11000 participants from communities of color representing 37% of the study population which is similar to the diversity of the U.S. at large. This includes more than 6000 participants who identify as Hispanic or LatinX and more than 3000 participants who identify as Black or African American.

glivrl9,Actually 20 something or more people have died after this vaccine. All of them over the age of 80 and in hospice. Assuming it’s because of the strong immune response having to weather the storm. They’re allegedly reconsidering age  condition guidelines on giving the vaccine. But I mean if you’re not on your death bed there haven’t been any deaths associated with the vaccine. Also the only thing the vaccine does is teaches your immune system to respond to covid’s mechanism of infection. It’s so your body responds appropriately.

gszalng,Yeah so true. Both reports showed there really wasn’t anything wrong with the appendix after removal with both of them. There was but severe inflammation with both of theirs that showed up on the CAT scan. It was questioned by a doctor if it was a reaction from the vaccine since it triggers such a lymphatic response in some people that they saw a severe response with the appendix containing lymphoid tissue. Kind of the same thing that’s happening with swollen lymph nodes in women’s breasts and under armpits. The other piece is that the woman tested positive for a UTI with Enterococcus slightly after surgery. So could it have been from something they ate? Her family doctor doubts it’s food related.

glaeupr,Don’t quote me on exact numbers but I think 23 women got pregnant in Pfizer’s trial and 13 in Moderna’s. They were either very early preg or conceived after 1st dose of vaccine. I just had to get the vaccine at 15 weeks preg bc placenta is previa. So I’m at risk for bleeding (thankfully haven’t) but if I were to get covid while pregnant the recommendation per ACOG is to put preg covid + women on aspirin bc of high risk for blood clots. So I was basically told they don’t want to have to make that tough call about putting me on aspirin or not so to get the vaccine asap. I would have much rather taken the vaccine prior to getting pregnant though if that had been an option.,Drink_allthe_coffee,2021-01-29 20:53:19+00:00,,0.4125925925925926,0.1501234567901234,Positive,l7x54a,l7x54a
gmxizg8,Because fewer companies are gonna want to participate.As much as I’m a proponent of the free market emergency situations like this are an example an example of something they don’t deal with well because a self interested company isn’t gonna see the risks of developing a vaccine as worth it if they don’t think the chance of profit outweighs the cost of development. One of those costs is legal costs. For every legitimate lawsuit there are several times as many meritless suits that companies still have to fight and factor into the overall cost and chance of profit. In the interest of speeding up the process and getting research and production done as fast as possible the government is bankrolling virtually all the costs for companies developing vaccines including research and development which means even companies who’s planned vaccines wouldn’t bring enough of a chance of profit for them to consider putting through the cost of research clinical trials etc. under normal circumstances can continue without worrying about cost. They’re also paying for the production of certain amounts of product even if it doesn’t end up getting approved. This ensures as many vaccines are being researched at once as possible and there is ample supply so that when they are approved they can be shipped out quickly.Overall it’s really more of a government project and they’re basically renting private companies’ resources and scientists to do it. The government is taking on every other burden and financial risk so it only makes sense they take on legal burden. This also isn’t much different from every CDC recommended vaccine just instead of Congress having to appropriate specific funds for compensation like they do in this case there’s a tax on every vaccine that funds that program.,JDHuff185,2021-02-11 12:29:36+00:00,,0.4498511904761904,0.1662202380952381,Positive,gmxe436,lh9sfn

gj2qwxc,I think you should get the vaccine but really the choice is up to you. Here's the thing- we've been studying vaccines for years and years and years. These new ones have been in trials for a year too!     I understand wanting to know all the research and effects before you take it. That's why the FDA required such intense data and studies before they approved the vaccines. We know from how vaccines work that they have a very very very low risk of long term effects. Most affects are just 1-2 days of feeling crummy and then you get better. Have you looked into the study results yet?I think we need to consider too the long term effects of COVID. We've seen that it can cause brain problems. I don't want to risk getting COVID and having it mess with my brain so I'm going to get vaccinated when I can.

gqnce21,Definitely not looking for a lecture regarding my parenting decision but I shared this controversial choice because it was a huge step for me to get the covid vaccine and I want people to realize there are people out there who are not all or nothing. I’m actively evaluating this choice daily and am considering what is in the best interest of my son but I have concerns for personal reasons related to my son that I won’t go into here. I live in CA so as long as he is unvaccinated he will not attend school. He does not attend daycare. I do not align myself with the crazed anti-vaxxers and am disgusted at the protesting that is happening at the vaccine sites. I think that anyone who wants a vaccine should get one and that getting shots into arms ASAP for covid is important.

l8iky4,"""Leftover"" (expiringopened?) Pfizer vaccines and effectiveness question Does anyone know the details on administering vaccines as far as how the age andor temperature affects the Pfizer vaccine? A local clinic here in the U.S. calls people on a wait list at the end of each day who live within minutes to come and get vaccinated with ""leftover"" vaccines in the last hour of the day apparently from people who didn't make or keep their scheduled appointments earlier in the day. I'm assuming the vaccines can't be kept overnight for the next day but I'm not sure why they do it. Two of my relatives received the vaccine at appointments early in the day and had soreness at injection site and slightly elevated temps within first 10 hours or so. I received the last vaccine of the day from the ""leftover batch"" about 6 hours later and literally had zero soreness redness fever or any symptoms of immune system being activated so I'm concerned it might not be as effective possibly because it was in an unfrozen state for a longer period of time (the clinic runs 12 hours long per day). I get a flu shot and have had multiple other vaccines over the last couple years and at a minimum I at least get some arm soreness. I was expecting with this one there was likely going to be heightened soreness at a minimum but literally nothing. My understanding with Pfizer is they are good for 6 months at that super deep freeze temp and about 5 days when put into a regular type freezer at 25 degrees. What happens after that as far as actually being put into use on a particular day in a hospital type setting is what I don't know. I thought I'm guessing they are thawed for a certain amount of time in the morning put in some type of portable cooler kept at each injection station and probably aren't supposed to be re-frozen after that. I believe I read the actual transport containers from the manufacturer have some type of temperature gauge or way of determining the temperature had gone below a certain point but not sure if it's known once they actually get to the clinic. I guess my question is if that's generally how it works how longhow many hours do they hold their effectiveness for in that scenario!? In other words if they are directed to be discardeddestroyed after 12 hours once thawed how much of their their effectiveness would they have lost by then?",Nei-Yeh,2021-01-30 10:05:14+00:00,0.0,0.4107448107448107,0.0695477945477945,Positive,1,l8iky4

gpnpsyf,This is impossible to put into percentages (of effectiveness) since every single person’s immune system responds differently.  So even if you have two people who are say the same age same medical problem and take the same dose of steroids one may have only a very slightly diminished response to a vaccine the other may have a more pronounced diminished response. Also our immune systems have more than one pathway to induce immunity which is a good thing. I would still be cautious after the 2nd shot (also keep in mind it takes 2 weeks to take full effect) until we know more.  I expect a third booster tailored to the change in the variant’s spike protein by ModernaPfizer which will help anyone who had a “less than full”response to the first two doses.,beyndthewaves,2021-03-04 14:59:20+00:00,,0.369047619047619,0.0951785714285714,Positive,lxl4d9,lxl4d9

It's not usually serious but some people may need treatment.SVT happens when the electrical system that controls your heart rhythm is not working properly.This causes your heart to suddenly beat much faster. It can then slow down abruptly.A normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). But with SVT your heart rate suddenly goes above 100bpm. This can happen when you're resting or doing exercise.,Maximus_20001,2021-02-20 10:25:07+00:00,,0.4232323232323232,0.0373737373737373,Positive,gnxjnmg,lmnm4l

I received my first shot on the 30th and experienced the injection site pain and a headache which I expected but since the shot my nose and sinuses have felt very dry inside especially on one side. I’ve never had this kind of thing happen before and while not especially painful it’s quite uncomfortable. I’ve been rinsing it out a few times a day with a nose rinse just to get some moisture up there. I’ve also got quite a sore spot on one side of my throat to the point yesterday that it was pretty hard to swallow anything. The sore throat is better today but the dry nose continues.

It’s just a blueprint and once it serves its purpose it no longer has a role. mRNA vaccines have no influence on the other genes in your body. They code for a specific antibody and can only make that so they only interact with the transcription proteins to make that antibody. No “turning on” of genes (also not really how it works).

I did speak with primary care doctor as well as his cardiologist. They both supported getting the vaccine. Also they did not advise to modify his medications prior to getting it. Just make an informed decision it’s the best you can do.Edit: he received Pfizer and he is 87..whoops,moloves,2021-02-25 19:39:18+00:00,,0.275,0.275,Positive,lsbj19,lsbj19

mfp94t,Pfizer and chronic pain I’m a 40YO male and I suffer from severe chronic pain that stems from a motorcycle accident. My pain is managed well with an implanted spinal cord stimulator and medication. I got my first Pfizer dose on Friday. At first all I had was mild soreness at injection site. However in the days since my lower back pain has increased exponentially. It has almost gotten to making me immobile. I have maxed out my stimulator and medications and it is not enough. There are no other side effects I have noticed. No fever or flu symptoms. Just the pain increasing by orders of magnitude.

Second you called out obesity and diabetes and their “victimhood.” Sometimes these things occur for medical reasons outside ones control. Clearly you believe Republicans to be inferior to Democrats with your remarks about your city’s governor.

gsir68r,From my side I am certainly try to stop people making the biggest mistake of their lives. I can't know what your true intentions are but if they are indeed good then as you say we are both trying to help people from different sides. I am negative about society and it is exhausting but my opinions and convictions are build on much research and not being scared to look into the shadows where evil never sleeps. If you grow up being taught that everything around you is more or less okay (which is incredibly naive considering the pain in the world) then you don't need to investigate further but if you are thrown off that programmed path you come to learn that the world really is run by a superclass who are demonstrably responsible for so much of the planets problems. There's not much that doesn't fall under their sinister umbrella of control. I'm not delusional but you are certainly trained to attack me as if I was. The term 'conspiracy theorist' was invented for that very reason.Are you so sure that what I'm saying could not be correct? I'm telling you that I've investigated what you haven't and come up with a different conclusion yet without doing that work you are able to tell me that I'm paranoid. How is that?For example the media blackout on a subject like vaccines which is serious and needs to be discussed from both sides which includes your efforts is extremely pernicious. I can't stop you taking a vaccine that I believe to be evil but just like you I should have a right to voice my opinion about it which you are trying to shut down. It's too important to censor and you should understand that there are millions out there who believe what I do based on mistrust of governments and vaccine companies who are notorious for criminal activities against their own citizens. There's so much that I know you have not considered and have not looked into and moreover would not be willing to look into that I am aggrieved that you would want to silence me. That the media is not allowing even debate from the other side and just uses blanket terms like 'anti-vaxx' to ridicule people who are literally trying to fight for the last remnants of freedom that you don't even know you are about to lose should be all you need to know that you are on the wrong side.,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-27 22:50:05+00:00,,0.5645860145860145,0.0173530673530673,Positive,gsilefm,men1ml

While Pfizer is a company that has been around for over 100 years does this discount how safe Moderna is compared to Pfizer given that it is a new company that just started operating 10 years ago and it has never produced anything for mass distribution?

Also considering they found a tumor I’m assuming that means you are going to need additional care for it? If so you really should get the second shot so you can visit a healthcare setting and be protected. If your pharmacist recommends you get it then you should even with the family history and everything going on. One thing I like to do with my anxiety is look at the positives of getting that second shot. What can change if nothing bad happens from you getting it?Also reward yourself after you get it. Think “first I’m going to get this shot then I’m going to do something I love” .Also try to remember that these shots are safe.

My highest temperature reading so far has been 102.1 F (approx. 39 C) and I've had some abdominal grumblescramping that's noticeable but not debilitating. Fatigue and brain fog isn't too bad I've had worse while not sick. My arm is a little sore but nothing worse than a flu shot. Not sure if relevant but I have mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and I'm still recovering from a bad flare up. It means a certain type of immune cell is too trigger-happy and inappropriately releases too many inflammatory mediators in response to both harmful and some harmless things. I'm on Xyzal famotidine and Singulair daily. I'm wondering if MCAS could be contributing to the fever while my medication cocktail curtails the other symptoms.

mhx0bb,15 Million Doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine Thrown Out 15 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson one-dose COVID-19 vaccines were ruined in a production mistake at a Maryland plant subcontracted to manufacture the vaccine.  Further production at the Maryland plant will be delayed.  The incident does not affect Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines already shipped to states.  But throws into question whether Johnson &amp; Johnson will be able to meet its goal of 100 million doses by  June.  The company barely hit its goal of 20 million doses by the end of March.  The White House is advising states to expect fluctuations in the supply of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  With three companies producing COVID-19 vaccines government officials assert that Johnson &amp; Johnson delays won't delay the goal of widely-available vaccines by May.  However the delays may still set back vaccination rates moving into late Spring.[,COVID_VacciNATION,2021-04-01 14:53:23+00:00,0.0,0.3041666666666667,0.0416666666666666,Positive,1,mhx0bb

m4f5u6,Second Moderna shot on Friday 312 around 9am I had a sore throat and some mild ‘sick feeling’ on my first dose so I was preparing for a reaction this time around. Woke up at 1am with some of the worst shakes of my life which when they ended resulted in a low grade fever. Didn’t sleep barely at all through the night and I’ve only managed short hour or less naps here and there. Had a heart palpitation around 3am that made my heart race but some breathing exercises took it down enough so I was able to lay back down. Today it’s battling this fever and the body aches. My skin hurts from the perpetual goosebumps without a blanket but I’m burning up with covers on. Very frustrating. Right now my fever has spiked again at 101.7 but I’m drinking Gatorade and tons of water. Even managed to eat a little.

gsrhyzs,This. Look into it and ask your doctor but general conclusion is that you don’t need the second shot if you’ve already had Covid.

gn58jz3,I had my first Moderna shot on Tuesday of this week. I have Fibromyalgia and Ehler's Danlos Syndrome. The nurse that administered my shot told me before I got it said I would definitely have a sore arm because they give it in the muscle. I usually even have a bad reaction from the flu shot. She also told me because I have never previously been tested positive for COVID the side effects would be more severe with my second dose. Definitely not trying to scare you in any way just telling you my experience. She said people who have been exposed to COVID have a stronger reaction to the first dose people who haven't the second. I only had a really sore arm for two days deadening fatigue (I slept for fourteen hours straight the first night after which is unusual for me) and I didn't have much of an appetite after my first shot. I am definitely worried to get my second dose now reading peoples experiences but side effects from a vaccine essentially will be a walk in the park compared to what actually contracting COVID could potentially do to you. Seriously... Just search COVID longhaulers and you will be glad you are got the vaccine. Plus the thousands of people who want it who can't get it.

gql0mqk,You’re very welcome! I’m glad I can help! So the vaccine side effects seem to be different for everyone. I had the Pfizer and 10 hours after getting the second dose I had chills and muscle aches that got worse throughout the night and I had a fever that peaked at 101. But it went away after 15 hours of the onset I know of two others who had the same and three others who had no side effects at all. So I think it depends on the individual and their immune system. Sounds like your immune system went into overdrive longer than it should have you might be in that very rare population that had longer lasting side effects because I know some people have reported being down for way longer than the 1-2 days that they were projecting. My opinion of the side effects: I think they are a means to an end they absolutely suck to experience but it is a good reminder of how your immune system is actually working and doing it’s job. I think a lot of people (myself included) forget that when we feel sick it’s because of our immune system making us feel crappy and not the pathogen itself. That’s why some people died from the cytokine storm that was generated after being infected with the virus their immune system went into overdrive and ultimately killed them. But it sounds like you truly had an immune response that really produced the antibodies you need!

ggmfk87,What I have heard is that in the US it's generally the case that the US govt accepts any liability over vaccine injuries for all vaccines not just COVID vaccine instead of the pharmaceutical companies. So there is nothing unusual in this case compared to before.  What that means is that the responsibility in case of injury will be on the government and not pharma. But that of course is different than the responsibility being on the individual who suffered an injury.  While there is a tendency to dismiss any vaccine injury as a hoax this is actually inaccurate. There are actual vaccine injuries they are just rare most of them due to an allergic reaction.,bionicbunny70,2020-12-21 20:54:37+00:00,,0.4972222222222222,0.1027777777777777,Positive,kb105h,kb105h

ghtt3r6,AztraZeneca is also going to be an option and is not an mrna vaccine. This vaccine is now approved in the UK (and I believe other places are close). We are going to have options and there will be a lot of data that continue to be collected on all the vaccines. At this point it appears all the data is showing the vaccines have a much lower risk to your long term health than the vaccine. We are so lucky to have so many becoming available. Spend some time reading about the long term complications from covid and you will likely be running to the vaccine line (and I am ignoring the covid risk of death).,FlowersPink,2021-01-02 14:15:09+00:00,,0.550925925925926,0.1842592592592592,Positive,ght8upp,kotz7r

To state that none of these deaths were caused by the vaccine is being intellectually dishonest.

lgveyw,Be mindful about the way you talk about the vaccine on social media I have a friend who works 100% fromHome doing insurance. He got both vaccines already. He posted about his side effects from vaccine 2 on FB.  He dramatically said  “BEWARE OF VACCINE 2 &amp; it’s side effects!”  It was a total sympathy and attention grab. In the comments he went on to complain about being tired and having a severe headache. So many of our teacher friends are working in schools without access to the vaccine. They were pissed off listening to a fully vaccinated person-who works 100% remotely- bitch about a headache in a way that spread fear and implied you should “beware” of the vaccine. A lot of us were upset and talked to him about it. It’s okay to talk about symptoms but I hope people do it in a way that isn’t speculative scary or deters people fromgetting vaccinated. Try to think about the impression your vaccination posts may leave on others or at least be aware of the resentment that people who can’t be vaccinated yet might be feeling. Overall I want to say please be mindful about what you post it’s a scary and difficult time for everyone and I think we need to be responsible and really think about the way we talk about our experiences.

I have several health concerns some of which are still mysteries (over a year of chronic pain and migraines that have yet to be diagnosed) some are not (asthma) and Im an essential worker interacting with people every day but not at a grocery store. My partner is begging me to get a vaccine through a local clinic by fibbing about having 2+ health conditions that would make me eligible. He's worried about my health and the risk I face at work. As well as any potential spread to him though of course if he did contract if it would presably be minor now that he's been vaccinated. But it's not technically my turn. He thinks he's arguing for my life while I'm here arguing for someone else's life (someone who may be more in need). And he raises the point that so many are doing this very thing.so I'm gambling with ""life"" so I can keep my morals. Anyone else going through this?

mgi03v,Anyone had their mononucleosis return after the vaccine? I was wondering if anyone felt this way after the covid-19 vaccine? I had mono 5 years ago but with complications. I had extremely debilitating chronic fatigue and a sore throatswollen glands for about a year and a half and constantly testing positive for infectious mononucleosis. I also developed some thyroid problems at the time possibly due to mono (resolved when my mono left). I only got better when I started following homeopathic medicine advice as Drs. said they couldn't do anything (took lots of vit C and D zinc and ate raw garlicginger and bone broth).I received my first dose of COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine 3 weeks ago and I was totally fine for the 2 days after which are supposed to be when you get side effects. Then the weekend came and I did a lot of activitieswent drinking with my friends seeing as I was totally fine. I woke up the next day with terrible achessore throathit by a truck and just assumed it was a bad hangover. However this feeling persisted into the next day and the next and the next.Now its been 3 weeks since I got the vaccine and my aches aren't as bad but I am soooooooo tired all the time even though I sleep 10 hours (my normal is 7) and my throat is sore. I've stopped exercising and walking my dog takes everything out of me. It feels just like when I had mono but I cant find any information out there about the vaccine and epstein-barr.

My father first tested positive after he took the first Pfizer dose on Tuesday March 2nd at CitiField. He had been working during COVID-19 and he had never tested positive while working or at home or anywhere else but almost 2 to 3 days after he took the Pfizer vaccine he experienced symptoms and eventually tested positive on Sunday March 7th.

Three have had their first dose of the vaccine and are scheduled to get their second dose in the next week or two.  The other employee and I become eligible in early April and while I will get vaccinated as soon as possible the other employee will not.My question to this subreddit is not how to convince this coworker to get vaccinated but rather **when and how can my office relax its covid policies if one employee does not get vaccinated**.Our desks are already spaced apart by a distance of at least eight feet and we have a humidifier running but those are neither direct responses to Covid19 nor burdensome.Our current covid-specific policies are as follows:* Only employees are allowed in the office* Everyone must wash their hands upon entering the office after eating and after using the restroom* Plastic curtains must hang between all desks* Employees must wear a mask whenever they are away from their desks* All windows and doors must be opened for five minutes every two hours* Incoming mail must sit unopened for 24 hours following delivery* If any employee travels out of state for a period greater than 24 hours or learns that a Close Contact (as defined by the CDC) has tested positive for Covid-19 that employee must quarantine for at least 72 hours (either upon return or after last contact) and then submit to a PCR test.  The employee may only return to the office if the test is negative.I'd be happy to explain other measures we undertook and subsequently discontinued but as we approach full vaccine availability for everyone in the office we are trying to figure out how to proceed if just one worker does not get vaccinated.Any constructive thoughts or advice is welcome.,ttd84,2021-03-16 18:01:55+00:00,5.0,0.4518939393939394,0.0740530303030303,Positive,1,m6f6m7

gsz9ds6,Its unlikely that many people have gotten pregnant and then carried a baby to delivery AFTER getting both doses of the vaccine since its only been available to a few reproductive aged females since DecJan. As the eligibility changes we will see more women of reproductive age get pregnant after having the vaccine.So far there is no evidence of any increase in miscarriage birth defects or pregnancy complications with the vaccine. COVID infections in pregnancy can lead to maternal ICU admission pneumonia and respiratory distress. Luckily there is no evidence that COVID infection crosses the placenta no increase in still birth and no other known fetal complications.So in summary: Vaccine = no known risks of pregnancy complications. COVID = increase maternal risks in pregnancy.&amp; x200B;Source: [ H3161640667]( H3161640667),RandomUsername1119,2021-04-01 00:58:52+00:00,,0.5852564102564103,0.0778846153846154,Positive,mhd9a1,mhd9a1

mgu8c1,Second Pfizer dose effects more severe Caveat: As per usual this is a personal experience story and not meant to replace licensed medical practitioner advice. Please consult with a licensed physician before taking any medication. The purpose of this post is to point out to people that some effects can be severe enough to adversely affect things like home and work life for a short period of time and what can be done to prepare being taken out of commission for a day or two. **CDC and WHO recommendations clearly state that covid vaccine benefits outweigh the risks involved.**I was provided with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 19 days apart. The first injection was given to a 32-year old patient (myself) March 19th in the upper **right** tricep and was followed by mild soreness in the localized area which persisted for approximately one day. No other adverse effects occurred prior to the second dose.The second dose was given March 29th at 1:45 PM in the upper **left** tricep with an identical symptom of localized soreness. No other effects were noticed until a recorded time of 5 AM on March 30th. Symptoms began with extreme chills similar to what one would experience during a hypoglycemic attack. At 5:10  an onset of other symptoms occurred simultaneously - fever extreme muscle ache and pain headache and extensive fatigue. The fever was periodically measured and plateaud at 102 F at approximately 6:00 AM. All other symptoms were consistent in their severity and persisted for approximately 12 hours before subsiding. The fever came down to 100 F at 8:30 PM by which time the chills and headache had receded to negligibly noticeable levels. Fatigue and muscle soreness persisted with significantly less severity but still noticeable enough to adversely affect movement.**DEALING WITH THE EFFECTS**By far the absolute worst and most debilitating effects were the combination of fever and chills. As I stated earlier the chills were bad enough to make me think i was having a really bad low blood sugar attack. My entire head was burning up while the rest of my body felt like it was trapped in a tundra I am not joking. I didn't take any medication for those symptoms right away since the onset was gradual and only got worse as time progressed.I don't recommend piling blankets on top of yourself if you do experience these chills they made the headache and fever a hell of a lot worse for me. It was extremely uncomfortable and I was basically stuck in bed with limited movement capabilities so I wound up just shivering until I had finished recording my vitals and passed out periodically. The severity of some of these effects vary from person to person with many not experiencing any symptoms at all. This post is meant to target those who do wind up with more severe effects so plan ahead: if you have work or school or social or financial obligations and you are in a position to give yourself one to two days to recover please do so because you *will* need it. In my case for example there is no way I would be able to work a manual labor job or even drive. I did wind up taking an advil for it's fever-reducing properties which seemed to work for a few hours and was enough to make me comfortable enough to either fall asleep or pass out - I'm not quite sure which. Other than that the symptoms in my case certainly did tend to recede in severity fairly quickly much more so than if I had been sick with the flu or something. Actually it was basically like catching the flu with everything except congestion and coughing. So in my case I didn't need to do any extensive preparations just a much needed long rest water and a fever reducer near the end. As a final note: there are other effects from covid vaccine doses which I did not seem to experience such as nausea. In other people's cases they might find that to be a more severe and significant effect which requires addressing. So for this vaccine in particular: it may be beneficial to plan ahead and set aside one or two recovery days for each dose given including boosters if any. Please consult with a licensed physician for medical advice.,ShjinoHaruko,2021-03-31 00:43:45+00:00,8.0,0.4437211171388387,0.0131153305203938,Positive,1,mgu8c1

lo9fj1,Received Pfizer vaccine today (1st dose) I’m amazed usually I’m terrified of vaccines and end up having panic attacks but I guess knowing the importance of this vaccine helped me deal with it because I didn’t panic at all and the staff were lovely I’m visually impaired so my partner came with me to look after my guide dog and we got in the building and I was taken straight into the room they were quick to offer guided support and knew exactly how to ask what help I needed which is nice because sometimes it doesn’t happen like that. the nurse was understanding of my nerves but was just matter of fact about how I wouldn’t feel it as long as I relaxed - I actually didn’t know she’d even done it until she said “and now it’s done” cuz I was focusing on doing the things she was telling me It’s been a couple of hours now and I’ve taken painkillers as advised (she warned me of headaches and a sore arm) but so far I’m absolutely fine Was an easy and calm experience with super helpful staff - just grateful I’ve been able to get it ☺️,LaursWillis,2021-02-20 15:30:58+00:00,4.0,0.535,0.2444444444444444,Positive,1,lo9fj1
mgf3nk,Bailed out of my second COVID Vaccine dose at the last minute From a friend of mine:I got the first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine a month ago.  Within hours of the shot I went from feeling great to just plain sick.  I had all the side effects they talk about-- times 10!  It took me a week to feel better.  I had to call sick from my job and I don't have sick pay.  Now I have to borrow money from my folks to pay the rent.So 3 weeks later I had my scheduled second dose of the COVID Vaccine.  All my friends and most of the posters on this board tell me the side effects of the second shot is usually much worse than the first.  OMG! How can that be?After finally feeling better after my week's long illness from the first shot I felt so great.  I am on a health kick.  I take many vitamins eat well exercise 60 minutes a day and have the advantage of youth and good genes.  Why would I want to go from feeling great to put a shot in me that will make me feel rotten? The night before my second shot I was all keyed up.  The thought of getting sick for a week again and having to take more time- without pay- from work scared me.  But like a good citizen I  drove myself to the local CVS Pharmacy to get my vaccine. But once I arrived I changed my mind and did not get the shot.Call me terrible call me a fool but I think for now the one Vaccine shot which gives me 80% protection is good enough.,rarelywearamask,2021-03-30 12:40:23+00:00,6.0,0.4807219662058372,0.1004032258064516,Positive,1,mgf3nk

ghl6u4t,I wonder. Why would a vaccination against a disease make sense when the virus is already in the body?The virus is the real deal - the thing that your body will built antibodies against. You can say having the virus enter your body is in a sense a vaccination (and your immune system - i think - will be better trained to fight off the disease than with having just a part of the virus in the body. But I don‘t know - maybe with testing positive and not having an outbreak of covid yet the body will be better prepared with the vaccination.I wonder though if the vaccination doesn‘t confuse the immune system. The immune system learns new things with every illness - i wonder if it learns false facts with a vaccination which might influence the immune system in the long run and with fighting illnesses we contract in the future.Anyways.

Not because we are doing anything wrong or stupid but because in most cases we come into contact with several groups of people who may or may not have the disease. Yes I know service workers but they don’t have prolonged contact. CDC guidelines determine that to be 10 minutes. That’s very easily avoidable in most service jobs. Yes I know the elderly are particularly at risk. But here’s the thing they like everyone else who isn’t working can stay at home. It sucks. I know.

Plus all the mixed stories it was a lot and totally not helpful to my already severe anxiety.I am student teacher and I got my vaccine on Jan 20th. A day before I stopped all my medication and started drinking more water then normal. The day off I went and from the moment they poked I massaged my arm and throughout the day I stretched it and massaged. That night it felt a little sore but like any vaccine. The next day I was back to normal! No second effects absolutely nothing different. A lot of us in our school have received it and besides the arm soreness we were good to go. I’m talking from me that’s 25 and people ranging from 20-35 that are fine after the vaccine. I work with kids and there grubby hands literally on my face and stuff daily so it was a risk worth taking. I’m happy I paid attention to my own research and colleagues and got the vaccine.

gt47ff0,Hello again! It's been 37 hours now since he had his shot. Last night he only slept maybe five hours and kept waking up. At one point he got out of bed for a couple hours because he knew he wouldn't be able to fall back asleep but was able to for about three hours when he felt a little better.

gkha3ll,Hi! There are two different types of COVID tests:1. A test to see if you have an active infection2. A test to see if you have antibodies for COVIDIf you take test 1 for an active infection the vaccine will not make you get a positive result.If you take test 2 for antibodies you can test positive. That's a good thing! It means your body is protecting you from the virus. Now under each of these types (1&amp;2) there are different styles of test: like for active infections ( 1) you have rapid antigen tests and molecular PCR tests. So the testing structure can get even more confusing. But right now every country is asking for a PCR test if you want to travel. The PCR test is the type  1 test for an active infection and again the vaccine will not make you get a positive result on this test.     So you'll be fine to travel once the world settles down again! =),LadybirdFarmer,2021-01-24 01:48:02+00:00,,0.5663104256854257,0.1394638347763347,Positive,gka4of2,l3295v

gsnjjuy, I am definitely leaning towards pro-vax but ABSOLUTELY agree with you here. The vaccine should be recommended but not mandated.

I’m due to get the Moderna vaccine this weekend. It’s been my understanding that 14 days after the second dose I will be less likely to contract Covid. Basically I thought I’ll be protected ( at least over 90%). However I’ve read that the vaccine only prevents me from getting a serious case of It or contracting it all together but does NOT prevent me from transmitting it. This makes no sense to me. How can I be at risk for transmitting it if I don’t get it on the first place? So confused! I will still practice mask wearing and safety but would like to see a close friend at some point but not if there’s risk.,Particular_Bug266,2021-02-03 19:45:29+00:00,4.0,0.5522727272727272,-0.1037878787878787,Negative,1,lbwas5

lakzeq,Is there a way to know whether you will get the Johnson vax or the PfizerModerna? I booked my vaccine appointment for March 17. Considering that I made my appointment before the Johnson vaccine has been made available does that mean that I will be getting the Pfizer or Moderna? Or will these things change in March once the Johnson and Johnson vaccine has been made available nationwide? I would strongly prefer the Pfizer or Moderna as it is significantly more protective from everything I've heard.

I am in no way trying to spread any misinformation just seeking an answer to question I couldn’t find anywhere else.Two weeks ago I received my first dose of the Phizer vaccine. I plan on getting a full STD panel done  but was concerned the vaccine might cause a false positive on some of them specifically HIV. My concern stems from the vaccine in Australia that was being developed but was canned after it was discovered that it caused false positives for HIV tests.Has anyone gotten tested after receiving their vaccine? Or does anyone think they can answer this question? I know this might come off as a little paranoid but I just wanted to see if I could find some clarity to avoid any potential anxiety.

Theres been no long term effect tests no data to confirm whether it will make you infertile or not and most importantly it doesn't stop you getting or spreading the virus. Yes it stops you dying from it but this virus is as deadly as the flu.  Pfizer managed to make it so that they can't get sued by anyone if it goes wrong.Imagine a virus so deadly you need to take a test to know you have it now imagine a vaccine so safe you need to be forced to take it.People will call me an anti vaxxer I'm just switched on.

Both wings are controlled by the birds headbrain which represents your de facto rulers. The information about deaths in the first link is true so what part of the political spectrum you think the site supports is irrelevant. The second site is a quick reference viewing of real information that comes from VAERS which is the official US government site to record adverse effects to vaccines.

gpidg01,You are not supposed to take Ibuprofen before the shot and not until you actually have symptoms afterwards. People get response to the second shot because they have a strong immune reaction to it due to developing anti-bodies from the first shot. It is pretty typical for people to have no reaction to the first shot but have a reaction to the second. My parents (&gt;65) both got their second shot. My mother was slightly tired the next day but my father started feeling ill about 5-6 hours after the shot and was completely worthless the second day..... They were both at 100% the next morning. The pharmacist told us (I took them) that most people have some reaction after the second shot but nearly everyone is 100% after 24 hours.,Im_100percent_human,2021-03-03 07:01:15+00:00,,0.3618421052631579,-0.0109649122807017,Negative,lwcfso,lwcfso

gjcq5tf,I’m a nurse. I have traveled to 3 facilities during the Covid outbreak to help where the need is great. In all I’ve had over 300 Covid patients. It’s for sure that I’m a front line worker exposed every single day. My current employer has offered the vaccine but I declined. I’m not necessarily against vaccinations however I’m not entirely convinced that what seems like a great idea now won’t have serious repercussions down the line. I’m hopeful that these vaccinations will come without any serious  post vaccine issues but the lack of ‘the know’ scares me. What I do know for certain is that I practice cleanliness. I’m careful. I wash my hands. I don’t wear artificial nails. I keep my hands soft and try not to allow my skin to crack-those little crevices are wastelands for germs-I take my uniform off at the door. I sanitize everything I touch (door knobs steering wheel keys etc.) and try to get adequate sleep and nutrition. I wear my mask and shield. I practice social distancing. I pay attention to what others around me are doing-and I redirect employees who are not practicing correct hygiene. I go to the store once a month and buy basic supplies in bulk during low traffic times early in the morning or later in the evening-early morning preferably as (if) retailers are supposed to be deep cleaning at night and most surfaces should be clean(er). I get tested 2-3 times per week and so far I have never tested positive. Coworkers have joked that I’ll be the last one standing vaccine or not.I support those getting vaccinated. I believe in having the choice but I find it concerning how the initial vaccines are being distributed. With the survival rate of Covid for people in my age genre even as a health care provider I’d argue that my vaccination would be better reserved for someone more vulnerable. Even if I do contract it the likelihood of long term complications or death is extremely low whereas an 87 year old nursing home patient has a much higher mortality likelihood. I wish the CDC had planned a bit more carefully how to disperse the initial vaccines. Healthcare workers are definitely at risk but with limited quantities those at the highest risk should come first-a 67 year old ER nurse with comorbidities and a higher risk of mortality trumps a 25 year old nurse working the window of a Botox clinic...,Pixiecricket,2021-01-15 15:50:05+00:00,,0.4583762798048512,0.0834677557891843,Positive,kxco7g,kxco7g

l3233w,How long does it take for the vaccine components to leave your bloodstream? I’m currently breastfeeding and have read everything I can find about this but haven’t found much. I’m just wondering if I were to “pump and dump” the milk for a couple of days post-vaccination if the vaccine elements might be gone from bloodstream by that point  making things safer for my baby. All the articles I’ve read say that it’s unlikely that the mRNA will get into the milk supply and even if it does that it would “likely” be digested by the baby and would pass through harmlessly. But what if it isn’t digested? What happens then? I know that babies have a more porous gut before they’re 6 months old so I figured it might be safer to pump &amp; dump for at least a couple of days afterwards. Any thoughts?

gqem7d2,Hello! I work in clinical research. That’s interesting that the study protocol is set up that way. May I ask who tested you and why you were tested for covid? I will say the sponsor side can be very slow with answers so unfortunately 9 days to figure out a protocol exemption is not unreasonable by the current standards. However I would recommend just following up on a regular basis because research can be very fast paced and you don’t want to get your request lost in the shuffle. Interestingly there are some clinical trials popping up globally that are testing different combinations of some of these major COVID-19 vaccines. There is even one combing the Astra and Pfizer vaccine. So while we don’t have the data right now the recommendation is to not mix and match. However this could change as we gather more data! So I think if worst comes to worse and this trialsite ends up not helping you there is a good possibility that mixing the vaccines is just as effective or potentially more effective! You never know :) it will work out! If your primary care doesn’t know this information I would let them know. They may be able to also steer you in the right direction on the 2nd dose. Or contact the study physician and light a fire under his arse to pressure the sponsor to give you an answer. Good luck!,StarLord001,2021-03-10 02:59:02+00:00,,0.5489750633981404,0.2145741758241758,Positive,m1jnwf,m1jnwf

Some people get fevers and that’s the only one that will raise concerns because some places do check temps. I would do some research on your airline and see what their covid procedures were but for the most part people would not outwardly know you feel like crap. As long as you tested negative for covid and have your vaccination card I think you’ll be ok. I don’t necessarily recommend traveling right away because your body hasn’t built up immunity and you might feel like shit. Worst case scenario is a possible delayed anaphylactic reaction which can happen 24-48 hours post but very rare. In that case being in the air with no epi pen is not a great idea. If you’re still going to go forward with it my best suggestion is hydrate like crazy and eat before you get the vaccine. It’ll truly help temper the side effects.,cindelouwh0,2021-03-29 15:49:26+00:00,,0.6209523809523809,-0.0053809523809523,Negative,mfr28q,mfr28q

gwfjkz2,One person should not trump the entire medical community.  That’s my point. You are letting one person -One person- risk your health and safety. Doctors are not infallible. But when the vast majority of doctors immunologists and virologists say something is safe you should believe them.    You believe the entire medical community when it’s AGs things like don’t drink arsenic and cancer needs to be treated with radiation. You would think someone is a crackpot if they said cancer can be healed with essential oils or coffee. This is the same thing.And no. The vaccine does not become completely ineffective with a new strain. We’ve already done studies on multiple new strains and the vaccine may become slightly less effective (90% instead of 95%) but it is still extremely effective against death hospitalization and long term side effects from Covid. We have data showing that Covid has -horrible- long term side effects such as brain fog damaged kidneys lungs lack of energy taste and smell loss and you have an 11% of getting those long term side effects. Meanwhile we have decades of data proving vaccines don’t cause long term side effects.   You are more at risk without getting the vaccine- not to mention you risk your life. A 40 year old at my work just died a few weeks ago from covid. Others have brain fog. Another is on oxygen and can barely walk. These are real. These are happening. The vaccine long term side effects aren’t real. They are just people who don’t understand science being scared.,kitzunenotsuki,2021-04-30 14:51:40+00:00,,0.398241341991342,0.0537878787878787,Positive,gwff4d3,n0upo3

[According to the CDC]( Covid-19 vaccines don't prevent infection from SARS-CoV-2 they just prevent you from ""getting sick"" from Covid-19.&gt; If you are vaccinated against COVID-19 you may still be exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. After exposure people can be infected with or “carry” the virus that causes COVID-19 but not feel sick or have any symptoms. Experts call this “asymptomatic infection.”So what is the purpose of the vaccine other than protecting vulnerable individuals from the symptoms of the disease when they do inevitably catch it? If people can still be asymptomic carries and infect others then the vaccine doesn't contribute at all to herd immunity.

If anything the more severe reactions have been usually observed in younger people (due to a healthier immune system and stronger immune response).,hopeful20000000,2021-01-31 02:14:03+00:00,,0.5277777777777778,0.0027777777777777,Positive,gk74axd,l215z3
gr08299,"Hey just wanted to say that you're not alone in this. I know you still have to get through it yourself but his is a common thing to be anxious about. Maybe that ""helps"" in a way. I got my first dose of AstraZeneca yesterday and I started (again) to take anxiety medication leading up to the appointment because after making the appointment (that was back in February) I most nights woke up anxious in the middle of the night heart pounding etc. I was in a constant state of nervousness when thinking about this. That said it also got better when I started watching some reliable sources that took some fear from me. Hearing other people stories (people I know in real life) and seeing the numbers about people that got the vaccine and that had bad reactions or side effects made me calmer (the percentage is very low). The vaccination was ok and I experience at the moment normal reactions such as high temperature and head and muscle pain.I am a teacher so I have a relatively big risk of exposure to covid and rearing about postlong covid syndrome Made the decision easy in the end. I don't want to have a scarred lung for the rest of my life or other problems. I don't know if this was helpful. If you have other questions feel free to ask.

ly2pw4,First Moderna shot 33 yo restaurant worker (essential in NY) experience Figured I'd throw my experience in since this sub helped a lot to calm my nerves last night. I have pretty bad health anxiety. If I have even a slight pain in my chest I freak out. Reading the experiences of others really helped. Be prepared to feel a little odd fellow health anxiety sufferers but understand it's just your body doing what needs to be done.  I took some vitamin D the night before and the morning of my vaccine. Also made sure to drink a lot of water and have a full dinner.Shot was at 9:30 AM. Felt a slight prick and then I was off to the waiting area for 15 minutes to make sure nothing was wrong. Got a mild hot flash the first few minutes. After that nothing. Reading this subreddit last night I started to deep rub the injection site and make sure to move my arm as much as I could.20 min drive home. Stopped to get gas. Got this odd brain fog. Hard to explain. It's like when you first wake up but you're just a little slow at processing things. After that a slight ringing in my right ear. I still kept moving my arm and deep rubbing the injection site. After an hour the brain fog went away the ringing lasted maybe another 30 minutes. I would say the worst arm pain was about 4 hours after injection. By the time I went to work it was just a nuisance even while lifting heavy loads of plates. 13 hours later feeling fine.,sil3ntwarrior,2021-03-05 03:16:58+00:00,9.0,0.4598299319727892,0.0124489795918367,Positive,1,ly2pw4

I found very little info about weed after vaccination so here is my experience.Got my first dose of AstraZeneca last week on a Saturday at around 4pm. Around 7pm I had some weed edibles ngl was pretty nervous about the combo but I didn't have any side effects that night(but I popped 200mg of aspirin just to be sure) went to sleep around 2am feeling completely normal.The next day (Sunday) I was extremely tired so I slept untill 6pm idk if it was only the Astra side-effect or maybe it was also the weed hangover from the edible. I also had a really bad headache and my arm was very sore.The next day (Monday) I felt similar to the day before but only like 30% of all the effects.On Tuesday I had no more effects except for last bits of arm sore.Overall I felt okay had no fever but I was extremely tired.,Dante_xL,2021-03-15 19:44:50+00:00,1.0,0.5095679012345679,-0.0107638888888888,Negative,1,m5t2zh

gr8uir1,Sure.  Show me the 5-7 years of clinical trials the prove that it's safe to use on all ages... oh wait... that data doesn't exist... it wasn't tested for that long....They said very clearly and very publicly that the vaccine wasn't safe for pregnant women yet pregnant women are still getting it.  There have also been plenty of adults who have very commonly had mild to severe side-effects from this vaccine.  I've been in the military and have traveled the world.  I've been vaccinated for a very high number of things and I've never had side-effects from any of them- this?  Hell no the number of side-effects are VERY much higher than a typical vaccine and everyone knows it!You want to start shooting kids up with this stuff?   Do you know how many adults it's put into the hospital and even killed?  This isn't normal.  The virus peaked all around the planet in every single state and country in just THREE WEEKS and then died off.  It hit 99% of the population and died off.  Now people are dying from the vaccine and you want to give it to small children.  That's not sane.  It's not safe.So no- you'll have to produce evidence that doesn't exist.,Glenduil,2021-03-17 15:24:03+00:00,,0.4550097001763668,0.1422169312169312,Positive,gr8tdfm,m71sxv

By your logic all vaccines are pointless. Many young and healthy people have gotten severely sick from Covid. Some have died. Some end up in the ICU for weeks. Many people have had to have their legs amputated or have suffered permanent organ damage. Even if you survive that doesn’t mean you come out unscathed.

Economies need to get back on track and employers will likely feel that requiring everyone be vaccinated is the best and safest way to move forward. In other words I do not think employers will require the vaccine out if ill will; they will do because they want to protect everyone else who works there and their customers. It’s tricky and complicated. But I think we cannot lose sight if the situation in which we are. Folks keep complaining that they are sick of restrictive measures.

( I’ve also been super sick too - threw up). Is this a symptom of the second dose or is this something else? Has anyone else felt anxiety after the second dose? I tried looking it up but there seemed to be no correlation so I’ve just been super confused and just want the anxiety to go away.,Fireshrimp420,2021-04-30 01:00:00+00:00,5.0,0.4557142857142857,-0.1397619047619047,Negative,1,n1iubb

lsa5zs,2nd shot of moderna - nothing special Hi allI thought I might share my experiences with everyone. Long story short I’m fine. I got the shot about 18hrs ago (4pm on the 24th) and it is now a little past 11am the next day. I’ve seen my friends around me who’ve gotten the second shot (mostly moderna some pfizer) and most of them felt fine on the first one but the second one hit them really hard for the first day. As for me although it hasn’t been a full day since I don’t have any fever or headache or anything. I could’ve gone to work if I wanted to but I’ll enjoy this nice vacation. I did feel slightly lethargic last night a weird sensation of not being sick or tired but something similar yet different. I have small sensation of tingling on my fingers which is what I get sometimes if I drink too much the day before.  One thing - is my arm that I got the shot on - hurts. Nothing terrible but it feels sore like after a very intense workout that I unconsciously use my left arm much less. But other than that I’m completely normal. I mean I’m not going to go for a run or a workout at this point but you know what I mean. I feel a little tired but that’s about it. Apparently not everyone has a similar side effect and I’m glad I’m not really having much. Ps: I get weekly tested for covid for my work and I’ve not tested positive ever.,hopefulfriday,2021-02-25 16:15:46+00:00,10.0,0.455280893349075,0.0031468909878,Positive,1,lsa5zs

You are free to believe whatever you want but there is simply no data or common sense to back the idea you will beat the virus forever while living in a society full of susceptible hosts 3. We don't know yet if Pfizer vaccine prevents asymptomatic transmission. Moderna appears to so there's a good chance Pfizer will as well but both certainly prevent deaths in virtually everybody.

ghn3jim,I never had a positive test. I fought something off at the beginning of February after spending a weekend in Vegas. Looking back on it it’s very hard to believe that it was not Covid. Fever off and on for about 4-5 days felt like my lungs were completely packed with slime incredibly weak tired and a cough that felt like my lungs were trying to turn themselves inside out and would make me double over in pain and dry heave. Couldn’t smell or taste anything either just thought that was from how congested I was. Work puts me in direct contact with multiple infected people a day there’s a chance I could’ve picked it up sometime in the last 9 months and been asymptomatic too.

I was then awake from about 3pm until 10 pm when I fell asleep again. Now I’ve been awake since 3 am and can’t fall back asleep. I’m wondering if anybody has experienced insomnia as a side effect of the vaccine? I’m not sure it’s related or if it’s just from working the night shift but I’ve never had issues with insomnia prior to this and normally I could sleep all day and all night after working a night shift. Just curious if anybody else has experienced the same thing.

Your mingling this viral RNA with your immune system this is not a vaccine this is symbiosis with a virus you better trust your instincts and stop being a guinea pig.

The first time I got the shot the only response I had was my arm just got mildly sore didn't need meds or anything for it. It went away on its own.The second shot I felt an intense wave of soreness about 3ish hours afterward? The pain shot up to an 8.510 while I was trying to sleep so I got up got ibuprofen  got an icepack and just chilled for a few hours while waiting for the mediction to kick in. The pain still goes up and down in waves it hasn't gotten lower than a 510. I also can't really lift my arm up too far without my good arm asssisting it. I found that pendulum swings hot showers messaging the area and ibuprofen are helping but I wish I was getting a little more relief.

gsnsd81,So I would encourage him to see a doctor.  These are not typical side effects.  Btw the m-RNA from the vaccine is destroyed in our cells within hours nothing remains and all you have then is the (intended) immune response which can greatly differ individually but I wouldn’t expect anything onset day  5.

gr123bn,Hi! Its really sweet to hear how worried you are about your mom. It shows you just want the best for her and don’t want her to get hurt. I am not a doctor so I am not medically qualified to say whether or not it is okay for your mom to get the vaccine. Does your mom have a primary care doctor? If she does see if your mom would be open to having a discussion with them- and including you on the call (since HIPPA laws would otherwise exclude you). Maybe that will make you feel a little more reassured.You will find many people here saying “my parent is [this age] and they were fine.” And that is great but like many have said: everyone is different. So really only talking with a medical professional who knows your mom can make the best decision for her.Good luck! 🙂,Jolly_Conflict,2021-03-15 16:44:25+00:00,,0.4529411764705882,0.3458333333333333,Positive,gr0zjaw,m5iiuk

l0tk5w,First dose today my experience so far. I (23f) just got my first Pfizer dose this afternoon. I have pretty bad anxiety around needleshealth stuff. The shot itself was almost painless. I told the nurse I’m terrified of needles but she was so kind and it was over in about 3 seconds. I was told to wait 30 mins as I have a history of moderate peanut and fruit allergies. Didn’t have any reaction. Within 5 mins all arm soreness was gone. Couldn’t even tell where I’d been injected. I went home and was still feeling pretty anxious. Had a bit of an upset stomach but that was probably from the anxiety. About 1 hour in my upper arminjection area was itchy and red. It went away within 15 mins. Two hours later I started to feel exhausted. I still felt mildly nauseous as well but that’s likely more form the anxiety. I laid down for a bit and closed my eyes. I’m about 3.5 hours post shot now. My arm suddenly got super sore and while I don’t necessarily feel sick I feel the urge to just lie down and do nothing. My brain feels a bit foggy too and I can’t really focus.,viola_goddess,2021-01-19 21:21:00+00:00,17.0,0.5639550264550265,0.0246362433862433,Positive,1,l0tk5w

gqgz9si,I do believe it is your personal choice - I wouldn’t shame you for saying you want to wait or don’t want to get it. There will be people who don’t want to. So far I see a majority of people are doing it. So far 11 million out of 39 million have gotten it in my state. I do know someone who is fully vaccinated and was around her family who all contracted it lived in the same house and everything and she is the only one that didn’t get it. Coincidence? Maybe. Or could it be that she was fully vaccinated? Who knows. Most likely! I think this will take some navigating and we will have to wait and see how trends go when more people become vaccinated. Trends here in LA county have gone down significantly since more people have been getting vaccinated. But still at least in my personal opinion if you don’t want to get it and want to wait I think that’s fine. The only people I judge when it comes with people not wanting to get it are the people that are spewing misinformation about it and are spreading conspiracy theories.

ghwrls6,I’m a nurse and got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Christmas Eve. The shot was exactly like the flu shot— an intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle. I was routinely monitored for 15 mins after the shot. Nothing happened. I was in a room with 10-15 other healthcare workers who had just gotten the shot and none of them had any reactions. For the rest of the day I didn’t feel anything and continued on with my day (day off). The next day the site where I got the injection was a bit sore but not as nearly as sore as the flu shot was this year. I tried not to put pressure there when I was sleeping or laying down. And that was the extent of the side effects I got. I’ve heard the second dose of Pfizer vaccine has more associated side effects so I’m mentally preparing myself for that. In my opinion I chose to receive the vaccine because the side effects don’t scare me. It’s the possibility of getting covid and the long term side effects I could get if I survive it.

m3rn5l,Concerned Vaccine Dose was Administered Incorrectly I'm curious if anyone else had this experience. I just received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine recently which was given more in line with the guidelines I've seen--sleeve up straight into the middle of the shoulder felt the pain of it going into the muscle. Heavy soreness within 12 hours of it. In contrast when I received the first dose the tech administering it prevented me from holding up my sleeve seemed to give it much lower on the arm (upper arm but below the deltoidshoulder) and I didn't feel the injection at all like it may have been given as a pinchsubcutaneous injection instead of into the muscle. I eventually had some slight soreness that night but otherwise nothing else. From what I've read afterward if not given into the deltoid muscle or deep enough it gets dispersed in the fat and becomes completely ineffective so I may have received only one effective dose.,Secret_Force,2021-03-12 21:29:13+00:00,3.0,0.403125,0.0864583333333333,Positive,1,m3rn5l

If you are young even by their statistics you don't even need it despite the onslaught of fear coming over the tell-lie-vision telling you that's it urgent.

If something goes wrong and it probably will down the line you can't get this thing out of your body it's permanent.There are very bad people behind this insidious technology and I warn against it.

After I got home I checked my oximeter and noticed my heart rate was at 110 and highest I saw was 124. To make sure everything was fine I rushed to the ER. There an EKG was taken and my heart was monitored for a while. The heart rate was 88-110  throughout that period. The doctor told me that it is most likely a reaction to the vaccine and should disappear within a few days. I am just really anxious now as I do feel the palpitations randomly.

gwsv8c4,&gt;The longer the virus keeps spreading among those who aren't vaccinated...The virus spreading indefinitely among unvaccinated isn't true. I realize this is a narrative being pushed but it is contrary to:1) everything we understand about immunology2) human evolution and3) everything we know about prior pandemics and epidemics.When someone recovers from COVID they have conferred immunity. How long this lasts we technically do not know yet but based on that same technicality we also don't know this for the vaccines. In reality both the vaccines and natural immunity should prove lasting UNTIL we start to see variants with significant mutations around multiple immune epitopes. Since Sars-Cov-2 mutates at a rate close to Flu (slightly less) this will likely be around 5 years of immunity against the worst of the disease for those who recover. (This has been found to be the immune escape rate for influenza).My point is - assuming we can reach a SIGNIFICANT portion of the population vaccinated the UNvaccinated population will not simply get infected over and over again. Those who have recovered are immune and the point when those individuals need to worry about immune escape is the same point as those who are vaccinated.The key folks in the equation are those who have NEVER been exposed and are also not vaxxed - but that proportion of folks shrinks every day since every infection pulls from this pool and adds to the immune pool.Tldr get vaccinated but also trust our immune systems and evolution to take care of the rest.,chris41336,2021-05-03 16:47:33+00:00,,0.4161064425770308,-0.0009803921568627,Negative,gwrfxx5,n3hw1f

Well technically yesterday Feb 25 at 9:45am.  It's 2:10am Feb 26 now and just a sore arm which I noticed around 9pm.  It's frustrating not to know when the side effects will take place because I have coverage here at work (a live-in caretaker position.)  I paid my coverage for 2 days--day of vaccine amd day after.  My daughter also went to stay with my mom since I'm a single parent.  After all this I felt fine all day and I realize I may have just lost 2 days pay for nothing....and I will be needing coverage in a few daya probably and may not have the money again.  🙁  Or people available to cover me. I'm expecting a big reaction because I have all kinds of weird health issues like dysautonomia rheumatoid arthritis vasculitis BFS raynaud's disease and possible lupus and fibromyalgia and chronic pain.  When I get sick I REALLY get sick.  But here I am feeling fine on day 1.  😏 Another fear is that I won't get ANY reaction meaning I won't build up any antibodies.  🙄  Yeah I over think things.

m2bg17,Iowa finally moves to stage 1B (my stage) but my county is punishing hundreds because of what the state house did! I live in Winneshiek county Iowa. I am a college student with type two diabetes as of this Monday Iowa is in stage 1B in their vaccination plan. However I looked at the news and according to the Winneshiek county health department they are not changing stages simply because they weren’t given advanced notice to the change in the vaccine stage. Because of this myself and many people that I live with cannot get vaccinated unless we go to another county.

gnits1j,That’s fine but I feel like it’s important to point out that the standard for success in these vaccines is considerably lower than traditional vaccines. Success is not measured on whether or not they prevent you from becoming sick. Success is measured by a decrease in the severity of symptoms.“It appears that all the pharmaceutical companies assume that the vaccine will never prevent infection. Their criteria for approval is the difference in symptoms between an infected control group and an infected vaccine group. They do not measure the difference between infection and noninfection as a primary motivation.”,Responsible-Annual21,2021-02-15 10:28:33+00:00,,0.4461038961038961,0.1774891774891775,Positive,gninfti,lk9gbb

m1ubf1,Front Line Healthcare Worker Unable to get Vaccine I am honestly kinda frustrated. I work for a great hospital in the suburbs of Chicago. No matter what I do or who I talk to the hospital can't find me a vaccine. It seems like they are not being aliquated vaccines for their employees anymore. While they have a active full everyday vaccine clinic full of the public. I work with patients everyday at bedside in the hospital and a decent majority of them have gotten the vaccine. I wish someone could tell me why a teir 1a health care worker can't get a vaccine.,LockTurbulent9061,2021-03-10 10:09:52+00:00,9.0,0.5439393939393938,0.0484848484848484,Positive,1,m1ubf1

But recently I’ve been having a lot of different things happen. About two days ago I had these weird flashes of light flying across my eyes. It went away almost immediately but it still startled me a bit. Last night I had a pretty vivid dream but it was relatively short and I went back to sleep with no issues. Tonight however I had back-to-back vivid dreams that continued forever. I finally woke up in a confused state and came to find out that I was only asleep for an hour.

It had no appearances on my arm (no redness.) i wasn’t able to sleep on that side the first night. But work and everything was fine. I did take a tylonal the first and second day but not because I had symptoms but just because the NP said it would be a good idea. I have had no symptoms past day 2 after having the shot.

gjrq16z,Here's some other things to think about (it's how fearmongering works): * 100% of people who receive the vaccine will die. * 50% of elderly people who receive vaccine will suffer from arthritis. * At least 10% of people who receive the vaccine will develop Alzheimer's.  [[1]]( * 0.1% of people who receive the vaccine will develop multiple sclerosis. [[1]]( * But only 2% of people who get COVID die.But the truth is... this is also true of the people who don't develop the vaccine.  These percentages are the overall chances of these conditions even without the COVID vaccine. And yeah 10 people at a single site having a reaction makes me think that there was something specific to that site.  And for more fun with statistics - you're statistically more likely to get wounded from a car accident while going to get the vaccine than you are to suffer a problem from the vaccine.,ChrisC1234,2021-01-18 23:08:52+00:00,,0.4136904761904762,0.0961309523809523,Positive,gjr7bv7,kzoh0m

It’s a doctor explaining that in the moderna trials this was observed actually and that in the second dose the reaction tended to occur less. Edit: the other symptoms beside the injection site might be in a different boat. For the record I’m not a doctor.

gpp1izn,&gt; I was simply pointing out that correlation does not imply causation It's hard to read this other than giving plausible deniability to the jab in direct conflict with the story being told.  Why?  The impetus is on the vaccine maker to prove that their product works and that it won't harm the recipient.  I'm as certain that there IS a connection as Pharma is that there is not (Because I'm a vaccine safety advocate with vaccine injured family members - they have a long history of sweeping adverse effects under the rug).  But I'm not the one trying to breach the skin of every human with an experimental product for which the truth about the safety and efficacy cannot be known.  Yet they tout that it's safe and they preach that it's effective - It's too soon to know.  Their unsupported certainty should concern us all.,pronghorn97,2021-03-04 20:38:10+00:00,,0.4495670995670995,0.1406926406926406,Positive,gposfqk,lxkrjr

In rural New Mexico I’ve only known of people filling out all of that online to register with the state to get appointments. It’s all of that info. Insurance too. Day of they go back to the site to complete the kind of health questionnaire you’d fill out in the waiting room of a doctors office. There’s some more repeat paperwork in person and you show your ID and insurance card to enter the parking lot and again after parked.

l6iiwi,"Ethics of ""lucky"" vaccinations: what about the 2nd dose? Someone asked a somewhat similar question below but I have a specific angle to this that I'd love anyone with experience in the logistics of vaccines or in the bioethics field to answer. There's been lots of reporting about people getting lucky and getting their covid vaccine despite not being in the at-risk group. Most often these people are getting shots that would just be thrown away at the end of the day. OK sounds great I totally get the ethics of that - keeping valuable vaccines from being wasted. However these people are also being automatically scheduled for their second shot to ensure effectiveness. So what I'm wondering is: doesn't this second shot effectively bump someone higher-risk down the list given the zero-sum game that's come out of vaccine scarcity? Lucky person gets their second dose that day it could mean an elderly or immunocompromised person doesn't get their first. That cascade goes on down the list. Unless there's something I'm missing here?It's both a philosophical question as well as a logistical one but I'm curious because I haven't seen it addressed in the many articles published about this like [this one in the New York Times]( where a bioethicist argued that anyone offered a vaccine should get it.Thanks!",starboard19,2021-01-28 00:11:43+00:00,8.0,0.4203137140637141,0.1268016705516705,Positive,1,l6iiwi

Preliminary studies are coming out right now saying its only 5 months and you are still a carrier but 10 people getting pregnant during the trials does not a study make.

I try ibuprofen but it doesn't work too well and I need to get sleep as its so painful I go restless for several nights.Also I already looked into my symptoms and it isn't an allergic reaction as most people in my life have suggested.

gjb6ace,Yes they will tell you and write it down on your vaccination card.  Most individual locations will only be giving out one of the vaccines as they have different storage requirements (not all and as some places move to bigger centralized hubs those are more likely to have both).  I doubt anyone at this point will let you choose between the two just on a whim (assuming you are in US and you have only 2 authorized) for a first dose but if you have the luxury of choosing between sites to get vaccinated you can do some research and get an appointment at a location that has the one you prefer.  However since the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are nearly identical I would be interested in why you have a preference for one in this case? For the second dose then it is important and expected to tell them (ie go back to same place or ensure you are going somewhere that has the same one show your vaccination card or otherwise communicate) which you got first so you get the same vaccine.  People think you could probably switch and it wouldn’t matter but nobody knows and theres no evidence about it to back up anything but going with same one.,dj8675308,2021-01-15 04:12:45+00:00,,0.4207070707070707,0.0906565656565656,Positive,kxlnhn,kxlnhn
lh4bdo,"Reminder about Pfizer and Nigeria Reminder that Pfizer and the WHO used a Meningitis outbreak in Nigeria to test an experimental vaccine that wasn't even able to pass animal tests. They didn't go through the necessary procedure to get it approved. They didn't even tell the government that they will test it on their people.Many people died. The rest got crippled.Nigeria then sued Pfizer - and Pfizer reacted to it by paying spies to launch a smear campaign against the state attorney that did run the case against them.Pfizer lost the case anyway. But the few million USD that they had to pay will never get the people back who they brutally murdered.Pfizer learned from that case - they now got legal protection and can not be sued. If something like in Nigeria should happen again they won't be liable for it.[Remember this when you get the experimental Pfizer CoVid vaccine injected in you that didn't go through the required stages of testings and could bypass those with an emergency admission.

Car home. But on my nursing home. There are residents that have oxygen that were a mask when they leve there room. Some when people come on there room. When they aren't falling well and want to protect the workers. Can you imagine wearing a mask were you live just so you try to protect the people caring for you? Only person in the room but knows about what time we get there and puts a mask on just for us. So we dont get sick. People who get to leave go home. See people in stores and we have more than them. But we are bringing it to them. And they still try and protect the workers. It is so sweet and hart breaking at the same time.So I dont like the anti-maskers much for that reason. As we as many others. They complain and dont do it. What about the people trying to take care of someone who needs it? It can be anyone. We dont know what anyone is going through and yet they are making promises for everyone. My aunt complains but she where's one.

Got vaccinated last Wednesday at around 4PM felt fine afterwards with minimal soreness at the injection site. Most people have had reactions at the post-12 hour mark but I didnt. I was feeling good enough to work the next morning even so I thought maybe this second shot wont be as bad as the first one (I had fever headache and body weakness back then).3 hours into my shift (I work in the OR department) came the intense pounding headache like something inside my head was actually pulsating and I couldn't bear to stand up for long periods of time. Had chills and body ache as well. Had to go home early because I knew I couldnt be of any use at my job if I was feeling so terrible. When I got home I immediately went to bed and slept. Woke up 3 hours later with high grade fever and headache. It was so awful a lot worse than what I went through the first time I got the shot.Anyway tried my best to eat take Tylenol and then went back to sleep again. No more fever this morning but the headache is still here. Decided not to go to work today as well because standing up makes my headache a lot more worse for some reason.Hopefully resting the whole day today can help me recover.,srsbsnss_,2021-01-15 01:35:56+00:00,7.0,0.4049999999999999,0.0134523809523809,Positive,1,kxk00t

I also had major anxiety before my first shot and I kept looking up stories of how other people's experiences were and it was kinda scary!! What helped me was putting it in perspective that millions of people have already been vaccinated since December and the few horror stories out there are such a small small minority and most people are just fine. If you're like me and have never had drug allergies statistics are on your side! More than likely you will be just fine. My first dose side effects went away in 48 hours. The other way I thought about it was if it was truly harmful there's no way they would give it to healthcare workers first because then you're basically decimating the nation's health workforce on purpose and it would take lots of conspiracy thinking to believe that is the goal lol.

ghyuxlk,1. If you'd paid any attention to the link I posted you'd see that excess deaths doesn't include cause of death. Ignoring any cause of death we have significantly higher deaths this year. The only possible response for why this aligns with COVID outbreaks is that they are related. Don't be so lazy and click the links shared with you.2. To this date &gt;1000 deaths  1 million people due to COVID. There are about 5 million doses administered between the US and Israel and not even 5 deaths after the vaccine. So if for the sake of argument we assume there are 5 deaths and they are all caused -BY- the vaccine that's 1 death  1 million people or 11000th what the virus causes.

giy29ig,The Cutter incident had nothing to do with the science behind the vaccine (we still take inactivated polio vaccines to this day!) or the vaccine production in general. One manufacturer did something wrong and the polio vaccine was not properly inactivated. This is because the Salk polio vaccine is a dead virus vaccine but to make it dead it needs to be treated with some chemicals. There is a small risk that this is not successful if the lab makes an error. It was a big tragedy nonetheless and led to the laws that now entitle people to government funds if they are harmed by the vaccines. Since then nothing like this has happened. COVID vaccine is mRNA which means it's impossible for it to create working viruses or be inactivated and we have had 9 million vaccines in the US almost 2 million in Israel and over 2.5 million in the UK over the last 2 months. If there was something like this going on we would have found out already so not only is it physically impossible it's statistically improbable.,pneumophila,2021-01-12 00:27:58+00:00,,0.5782051282051281,-0.2544871794871794,Negative,gito2di,ko7n69

gjew85x,Almost half of the Pfizer trial participants were over 55 and the mean age of the study was 52 indicating that a lot of people in the study were significantly older than 55. They were really careful to have a representative sample when they were testing for this exact reason. I think the biggest thing they noticed is that older people tend to have less side effects. It’s also currently being tested in the 12-17 age group and they plan to start younger kids within a few months. The testing for this vaccine was really well done and they made sure it was racially diverse and a diverse set of ages.

I'm a former senior level Republican pollster with deep knowledge of actual some active conspiracies primarily dealing with information for political gain. None of the people you're pointing to are involved in any of those conspiracies. In fact quite to the contrary the people involved in those conspiracies are telling to a lesser degree the story you are regarding COVID. Generally speaking the conspiracies I'm familiar with deal more with electoral politics and the creation of what are called digital simulcara. I could see the same people I'm aware of pushing this set of stories for similar reasons however. I'll wrap up with one final comment I suppose. The former President who has one of the most sophisticated psyop teams and efforts in history and on whose behalf most of the actual conspiracies are actually run took the vaccine before he left office as did his family.

ghlwpba,TANGENTFederal officials are aiming to have enough vaccine doses for every American who wants one by the summer of 2021. So far Moderna and Pfizer are slated to deliver enough doses for 150 million people roughly half the country’s population but it’s unclear which companies will supply doses beyond that. The government signed contracts for more than a half-billion doses from other drugmakers but their vaccines are unlikely to earn approval this year and Americans might need to wait until June for additional doses from Pfizer.CRUCIAL QUOTE“This new federal purchase can give Americans even greater confidence we will have enough supply to vaccinate all Americans who want it by the second quarter of 2021” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Friday.,Screamimgmonkey,2020-12-31 14:35:10+00:00,,0.392016317016317,0.0495920745920746,Positive,ghgsdcn,kmrgpa
gr5my6f,This is anecdotal but I have about a dozen family members who have all gotten their vaccines (either pfizer or moderna). One was as far back as early January (so months have passed for any side effects). Not a single one has had any major side effects. They all had a sore arm that lasted a few days and a few had few days of fatigue (especially after the second dose.) One of them got a fever that lasted about 24 hours (after their 2nd dose) but that went away.They all feel completely back to normal right now. And this includes my very frail 96-year-old grandmother. But not a single one of them has gotten sick since their vaccine (covid or a cold). I don't think you need to be worried. Sounds like being tired is normal. But if it continues for another week I would call your doctor. It is *possible* that you also got covid before the vaccine kicked it but unrelated to getting the vaccine. (The vaccine can not cause covid. It's not a live virus.) I would not be worried about any adverse effects on your immune system as a result of the vaccine though.,holdencwell,2021-03-16 19:25:00+00:00,,0.4418831168831169,-0.057401121605667,Negative,m6gpm1,m6gpm1

If someone had to twist my arm I’d say Pfizer just because of all the extra real-world post-clinical trial data provided from studies in Israel.

The CDC says it’s okay to take something AFTER the vaccine but not before. “If you have pain or discomfort talk to your doctor about taking over-the-counter medicine such as ibuprofen aspirin antihistamines or acetaminophen for any pain and discomfort you may experience after getting vaccinated. You can take these medications to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally. It is not recommended you take these medicines before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent side effects because it is not known how these medications may impact how well the vaccine works.”[Source](,MakeMeMew,2021-02-14 21:51:15+00:00,,0.4049999999999999,0.0975,Positive,gnfluz7,ljhgsg

m3hqyl,First Moderna Vaccine in the books Me f(32) and my partner m(34) got on a “waste list” Monday with our local Walgreens. We live in an extremely rural tiny town. Imagine my surprise when on Wednesday Walgreens calls and asks if we can be there within three hours! I may have squealed and scared the woman on the line. Oppssss. Not only that but it’s Moderna! Of course I drop EVERYTHING and go get my husband at the farm and away we go like it was Christmas morning and our presents were waiting at the pharmacy. We were giggly and beyond excited. Like could this really be happening?I pull my minivan into the pharmacy like Ricky Bobby would. “If you ain’t first you’re last” type deal. I also change into my “Not Throwin away my shot” vaccine Hamilton themed shirt I made for this occasion. We’re serious now and are all like “is this real life?” As we walk masked up into Walgreens and make a beeline for the pharmacy.After a zillion questions from the sign up window we finally get seated and the anticipation sets in. I was more nervous than a turkey the week before thanksgiving because at this point my severe fear of needles kicked in. I’m like get it together yo. This is science.It’s finally my turn and I go in and talk to the pharmacist who confides in me that I am the youngest person he’s vaccinated yet. Honestly the shot wasn’t bad at all. Like barely hurt at all. I told the pharmacist I wish hugs were allowed because I would totally hug him but I got he didn’t want covid. My husbands dose was nothing. Side effects wise we have had sore shoulders like someone goosed us and left a deep bruise and we’ve wanted to hibernate like bears. Every time I’m like “I’m tired” I’m like “hell yeah! The science is working!” And get all jazzed so it’s totally worth it. I have our second appointment circled on the calendar like it’s the date of the apocalypse or something and I count down days like a cult member would. I’m so relieved to know I’m on the road to being protected and protecting others. I don’t think there’s a better feeling right now than knowing I’m making a difference. I’ll keep you guys apprised.

There are doctors nurses CNAs OT PT ST RT HUCs environmental workers maintenance works that are ALL exposed everyday. Those who work within a hospital need to be considered first as they are most at risk. Those who are older definitely need it as well just not first. That's why they are next in line.,DevaXOXO,2021-01-27 18:30:24+00:00,,0.3333333333333333,0.1083333333333333,Positive,gkyxsq8,l68hso

Imagine taking this vaccine despite people in this and rCovidVaccinated threads and what they say about the after effects.   I live almost 30 years and never ever seen soo much COPE in 2 threads anywhere.   Remember about another dose you need to take how are you going to feel after 2nd one ? When first one is literally making you feel like dying ?  Is it really worth it to take this few months concoction for a virus that has maybe 0.7% mortality rate ?  You can kill it with Ivermectin HQC+ ZINC  Amantadine Ambraxol Wormwood Ambraxia. Literally cure is out there if you are willing to move your sorry lazy dumb ass to see.   If virus is so deadly then why Poland limited access to Amantadine(Parkinson medicine used for last 10 years here) for thousands of people with Parkinson ?  Had Covid myself lost smell and taste. Used HQC + Zinc D3 vitamin Wormwood and Ambraxia. 4 days later it's no more.   Damn I could cure myself with Ivermectin in 2 days if I had easy acces to it.

I chugged water and waited an hour...it was still the same so I went to the ER. I had completely freaked myself out. Bloodwork came back great EKG blood pressure etc. were all good. No explanation.

My arm did end up feeling sore after a workout last night. I had cold chills overnight which isn’t usual for me. I had a bit of anxiety when it came to falling asleep but I did eventually (also I find that sleeping on my left side is more comfortable usually but because of my arm pain being on my left side I slept on my right side). Today I had a persistent headache that is tapering off as of tonight but it got to a 7 out of 10 to the point where the back of my eyes were hurting oddly enough. My body has also been slightly sore but nothing I couldn’t handle. I’ve been checking my temperature and it’s been hanging around 99 degrees. Overall I think my side effects are not terrible so far.

If there is a phone number provided for Rite Aid vaccine questions you could call them and confirm that you are on the schedule. If that doesn’t work maybe call the specific Rite Aid where you’re scheduled for the vaccine to confirm the appt with them and if that doesn’t work take in your printed copy of the appt when you go for the vaccine. Rite Aid is brand new to delivering the vaccines and their web site is probably blowing up and could be lagging.

m6nn7d,Pfizer vaccine reaction ? I got my Pfizer Covid vaccine Sunday March 14. I felt fine until 8-10 hours later I felt my chest very tight and with lots of pressure. I sat up walked around and it pressure went away but then it became numb and like tingling sensation all around. I figured maybe reaction to the shot but I didn’t have any breathing problems or numbness in my tongue. Went to bed next morning my whole chest and neck was feeling numb and tingling. Throughout the day I stated to notice the numbness tingling sensation went up my face only on the left side. After some hours it went away.

mhx9xq,(31F) Second Shot Success! Moderna I was so anxious for my 2nd dose of Moderna and came here looking for someone like me to help calm the nerves.  I am a 31F overweight a light smoker slightly high blood pressure but I’m not medicated for it.I had my first dose on March 4th. No side effects besides a sore arm and mild covid arm 8 days later. No big deal.2nd dose on March 31st at 9:30am. Sore arm but I generally felt totally fine all day. In the middle of the night I woke up in a dead sweat and was running a 99 degree fever. Took two Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke up sweaty but feeling totally fine! I’m sipping my coffee and feeling good this morning. No insane heart palpations body aches or anything at all.I hydrated big time for two days before my second shot (drank about 200oz of water each day). I skipped my daily soda yesterday but didn’t skip my cigarettes (anxiety). I took Zinc and a women’s multivitamin for a few days prior to the shot. I have no idea if any of this helped but it kinda seems like it might have. Overall do not freak yourself out of the second shot. The anxiety was the worst part for me. I would do it all again in a heart beat. Good luck everyone!,maddhatter9891,2021-04-01 15:06:16+00:00,2.0,0.3294047619047618,0.1153869047619047,Positive,1,mhx9xq

gqvxnq7,I personally would not get a 2nd shot. Your antibodies are likely through the roof with having the vaccine on top of the infection. According to recent studies the infection acts like the first shot which primes the immune system and there is then a much higher antibody response with shot 1. Good luck with your decision. If you take shot 2 let us know how it goes. The people I know who had covid and then 1st shot  said the vaccine was WAY worse than covid (probably the high antibody response after priming),NurseSafetyLink1,2021-03-14 09:58:08+00:00,,0.4623333333333333,0.1459999999999999,Positive,m4jj6q,m4jj6q

gjrw0pq,I received my first dose a few weeks ago and was in the same boat as you. I work in medical but was pretty resistant to the vaccine due to the novelty of it and the concern for long term effects but did it because I know the sooner people are vaccinated the sooner we can all move on. Plus I wanted to protect my parents who can’t get it yet.  I am honestly still quite nervous about long term effects since none of us will really know if we have long term issues until months or years down the road. The best I can say is more than likely everything will be just fine. Vaccines very rarely cause any long term issues and ones that did were pulled quickly and caused very specific issues in specific populations. I think the risks of receiving the vaccine outweighs the risk of not receiving it. I see tons of covid patients a day and truly the vast majority of them have only mild symptoms or are asymptomatic but the ones that do get it severely get it very severely. You just don’t know which category you’d fall into. And a very concerning trend I’m seeing at my ER is we are seeing these patients come in that were covid positive a few weeks to a couple months ago and they are coming in with these severe lung issues. Their oxygen is low they are having difficulty breaking and when we CT their lungs they have extensive lung damage and I am talking severe damage that may lead to long term lung issues. Most of them said they only ever had mild symptoms when they were first diagnosed with Covid. These people we are seeing are not 80 years old they are primarily healthy 40 something year old men coming back in with these issues. Do with that info what you will. I will say I’d be prepared for having a rough couple of days after the vaccine. I had body aches chills 103 fever headache and severe fatigue for a couple days after the shot. My are was also so sore and I couldn’t move it overhead. Only a few other people at my hospital had these issues but if you look on Reddit you’ll see a lot of people have had similar experiences. So prepare yourself for that being a possibility.,Luna920,2021-01-19 00:02:23+00:00,,0.4385646235078053,0.1210996326905417,Positive,l04kwi,l04kwi

I received it in the morning and by afternoon I had a sore arm and a headache. By evening I was feeling feverish (felt too crappy to care about taking my temp) and that night I couldn’t stop shaking and felt achy and generally awful. This lasted for about 36 hours then I was back to normal. In browsing this thread I heard that people who previously had covid had similar reactions after the first dose but as far as I know I’ve never had covid. Has anyone else who has never experienced covid symptoms had a strong reaction to the first dose? Also for those who did have a strong reaction to the first dose how did the second one go?

But i am skeptical of this Covid Vaccine not because i think it doesn't work or scared of it's side effects. Thousands of people got it and only a few experienced serious side effects. I am skeptical because the origin of Covid is still unclear some governments are making the vaccine compulsary governments and employers are taking advantage of the lockdown to invade our privacy and freedom (not saying some of it is wrong). I dont even care it is just a way of big pharma corporations making big bucks (the rich are getting richer even though millions of people lost their jobs since this pandemic).

I had... a lot of concerns regarding the vaccine. It's new the side effects are scary (more so because my dad has Bell's Palsy so it might be in my genes and just waiting to be activated) and my first thought was... wait. Lets just see how it goes get more data on it and how safe it is. The plan was to give it until late summer or fall before I even got on any list. In early Feb I almost lost my brother to covid. His asthma along with the virus landed him in the ICU for 10 days. I think that was it. I registered my parents for the shot and when I took my mom there was going to ask about a waitlist or something that I can get on. Lucked out that they had extra shots that day so got my first then and there. I think its ok to be scared these are terrifying times. Just don't let that control your actions. See which you are more comfortable with and just do it. The more you think about it the bigger the fear becomes in your head. I got my first Dose of Pfizer on sunday (37). My side effects were a metallic taste in my mouth that lasted just over a day and muscle aches on days 3 to 5.

gmo5eb5,The test is for slightly different antibodies. The tests they’re using for studies are highly specific to antibodies designed for the spike protein (which is what you get after MRNA vaccination) but general antibody tests designed for people who have had Covid won’t necessarily be positive in people who are vaccinated. Most medical agencies suggest against getting an antibody test to gauge efficacy because it’s not looking for the right thing.,idkcat23,2021-02-09 05:58:12+00:00,,0.4008812615955473,0.1518552875695732,Positive,lfuefw,lfuefw

This shot protects against 99.9% of COVID known today. (Or whatever the statistic is) But in 6 months what if there’s a new mutant strand of COVID (called COVID 2.0 for example) and the shot that I had taken in March doesn’t prevent that strand. Would I still be able to take the COVID 2.0 vaccine or would my body fight that vaccine since I had the 1.0 shot in March? How does that work? Do the shots stack?

gsyg5hw,This is why all of those myths are such a bad idea. The public messaging about transmission is awful. You won't give it to someone else or catch it from someone else if you're fully vaccinated almost certainly. Nothing is 100%. I am sure the CDC is going to change its messaging to be more correct about all the things that can be safely done after vaccination. Almost everything. It's a pandemic killer. Even if you did happen to catch it it would be much less severe. No one has died FROM the vaccine. People die every day. Some people had cheerios for breakfast some went for a walk to the mail box- it doesn't mean cheerios or their walk killed them. The risk of blood clots after getting the vaccine is the same as in the general population. Lower than those on hormonal birth control plenty of people still take birth control pills without worrying about the risk. Coronavirus causes an extreme increase in the risk of blood clots in the young. People are afraid of the wrong thing.[[,BrightAd306,2021-03-31 20:48:37+00:00,,0.5454598506069095,-0.1023459383753501,Negative,mhf98n,mhf98n

gssawb8,if it makes you feel better the mRNA vaccine technology has actually been in development technically since 2002 during the original SARS outbreak which is closer to 20 years but it was never the capitalist gain it is now since this pandemic and has been sort of on a back burner slowly gathering research and development since then. And actually the technology was recently looked at as a possible treatment for cancer back in 2019 before the pandemic even started! Im sure that something thats been in development this long is probably as safe as the scientists behind it are claiming it is.

gnddhba,Look up the half-life of the medication you are thinking of taking to see how long it takes your body to eliminate it.But I wouldn't worry too much about it. Studies say that the reduction in immune response from taking Tylenol or NSAIDs is slight. And the immunity conferred by vaccines is very strong. They also say there is not enough information to know for sure about how these meds affect the vaccines' effectiveness. They're careful to use words like speculate and theorize because there's not enough data yet.That being said this article explains it pretty well: ,EvanMcD3,2021-02-14 07:22:49+00:00,,0.6232098765432098,0.1329629629629629,Positive,gnceu83,ljae37

l101uf,Given wrong vaccine. I had been anxiously awaiting my appointment today after doing plenty of research. In my electronic forms I checked the box for the Pfizer vaccine. At my appointment tonight I had to fill out the same form in paper format and also requested Pfizer. The moment the tech gave me the vaccine she said “okay you have received the Moderna vaccine here is your card” I told her that I requested the Pfizer vaccine and she said that was fine that she will let the office know that they ran out and that she gave me the Moderna vaccine. That wasn’t the point I received something that I was not consulted with. I am completely stunned. Don’t get me wrong I am extremely thankful to have received any vaccination at all. I don’t have any known allergies to have prevented me from getting one shot over the other but my parents do and I hope that the same doesn’t happen to them when they go in 2 days. And when I went home to make my second appointment they were no known appointments for Moderna only for Pfizer.My question is should I report this?,nachotacocat11,2021-01-20 02:53:52+00:00,20.0,0.56875,-0.0402777777777777,Negative,1,l101uf

gqupfxh,More programming. Your latest download is to conflate Trump and QAnon followers with other critical thinkers who don't blindly trust evil. The Trump and QAnon thing was a government operation which was played out so that among other things you would do exactly what you continue to do...shut down conversation. As I don't follow either and know that scam too you can't use it against me as they train you to do.Your uncle may well be a virologist...but unless he has himself isolated the new so called variants...hell..if he's isolated Covid at all which no one has done it doesn't mean anything. He's watching the tv and repeating what he sees and hears just like the rest of you. Being a virologist hasn't stopped him from believing all sorts of stupid things coming out of the media. In fact being more educated means that you are likely to be more susceptible to the propaganda because you think it can't work on you. I listen to people with the same credentials and more tell me the truth. They told you to get the vaccine so you could get back to normal life. Then they said that no you'll still have to wear masks and socially distance. Now they are saying that they don't know if the vaccine stops the spread of Covid and could potentially cause super spreaders. They are also starting to say that things will never get back to normal. You people are so stuck inside the narrative that you believe whatever they say and don't analyze what are actually the psychological warfare tactics. It's three masks now...how far can they take you? Is Klaus Schwab and the 'Great Reset' even on your radar?

gqz03xa,Hi!! I have the worst health anxiety as I’ve been sick for months (just found out this week I have a tumor too) I got my first dose last month on the 10th. I did it like a bandaid as I was not feeling safe at my healthcare job anymore. I got moderna and it didn’t hurt getting. I didn’t even realize he already gave it to me. I had a headache for a couple days and a sore arm. A week later my arm did get itchy and red for a day. I was terrified to get my second one because that morning my Snapchat showed some young girl dying after her second dose. I started crying in the line for my second shot so they let me reschedule to the next day. I didn’t think I would get it. But I did . My husband who had no intention to get it actually surprised me and got his ( he only has had a sore arm) this was my second dose and it hit me harder. I had bad anxiety but was able to sleep until 2 am when I woke up just wired with pains in my body. I got a fever at the 16 hour mark and was steady at 100.5 for a few hours my whole body had aches and felt like the flu. I’m on day 2 and not gonna lie my chest hurts and my heart has been racing but it’s mainly anxiety,worksong2020,2021-03-15 02:20:21+00:00,,0.3600931677018634,-0.0404761904761904,Negative,m50prb,m50prb

kni32j,The vaccine started a fight Between my wife and I. I signed up to get the vaccine today and when I told my wife she lost her mind because of horror stories she read online about allergic reactions. I'm not allergic to anything that I know of in my 33 years of life. I know how allergies work and I know that I haven't been exposed to EVERYTHING but it's administered in a hospital so if the worst case happens that's the best place to be. I briefly (very briefly) thought about canceling my appointment but I decided against it. I also considered lying to my wife about it simply telling her that I didn't get it just to avoid conflict.

gwj3zxk,I think  1 is that the vaccine does not give you a 100% guarantee that you won’t get CoVid. But if you are inoculated and do get it you will have a far milder case. If you were to get sick you would be able to spread the virus. No vaccine is perfect. We also don’t know how long the immunity lasts. I’ve read in a number of places that we may need boosters every year as we do for new types of flu. Can’t say I’m an expert on this but this is my understanding. There was a very interesting documentary on Netflix called “Pandemic” (How to prevent an outbreak?). Don’t recall full title. It is a series that looks at epidemics and pandemics all over the world.

gk5emta,Where I live if you are eligible for the shot your information is turned into the state by the institution through which you are eligible and then you are contacted by the health department to schedule your shot. They are not scheduling appointments otherwise. If you have a different system where you live and are somehow able to lie your way into scheduling a shot that you don't qualify for at this time you may be turned away on the spot when you show up and they can't verify your credentials. If you somehow manage to bluff your way into the first shot you are at risk of being denied the second shot in the approriate time-frame. What you are considering doing is something many vaccination sites are dealing with right now and many already have safeguards in place to prevent this kind of fraud.,twatwaffleandbacon,2021-01-22 06:06:50+00:00,,0.4994047619047619,0.2908441558441558,Positive,l1m30q,l1m30q

ggq0xeh,Hi there. I am in healthcare and received my vaccine on Sunday. I am planning on trying to conceive in the near future. Everything I read and have been keeping up with has said the theoretical risk is very low considering how this vaccine works. Also check out the Dr. Brojorkman on YouTube they talk about the latest recommendations (which they are giving women who are TTC are pregnant the green light). It is a very personal decision to make but this risks of contracting Covid while pregnant is not something I’m not okay with leaving to chance. I know I will be a ball of nerves going to work with no protection on my side for myself and my baby.

m11w9w,Eligible should I wait? [Throwaway account]I found out today on March 2nd in Las Vegas *End-to-End Essential Goods Supply Chain* became eligible. I work for a company that falls into essential goods as we provide IT technology and services to a healthy number of front line companies industries... For example we work directly with many healthcare provides in NV. I usually am working out of the company's main warehousefacility but because of my companies great response to COVID I have been able to work remotely. I am not 65+ in age; I also don't any impactful (to this topic) preexisting conditions. Working with so many people (remotely) in healthcare I know how limited the vaccines are right now and how people are doing everything possible to jump the line. I booked an appointment for later this week but now I am questioning if I really should get it now or should I wait. I want my team that is working out the warehouse and directly with the customer to get it now but I can likely continue to work remotely. COVID has caused me to have the first-ever full panic attack and getting the vaccine will hopefully help my current mental state but I was also resigned to waiting until later this year.

glbgudp,I had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on January 6 and I had a sore arm for about 2 days.  My side effects were very mild.....I felt tired and had a slight headache.  I just had my second dose on Wednesday and I felt pretty bad yesterday.  I had a slight headache horrible body aches chills nausea and I was very tired; I felt like I had been hit by a bus. If I wasn’t working virtually I would’ve stayed home from work.  My arm pain was about the same as with the first shot.  But I feel better today.....I just have some slight muscle aches so it didn’t last long.  But everyone reacts differently.  Three of my co-workers also got vaccinated on the same days I did and only 1 other person experienced side effects with the second dose; the other 2 only had a sore arm.and none of them had more than a sore arm and fatigue with the first dose.,cydnotsovicious,2021-01-30 01:30:38+00:00,,0.4632051282051282,-0.0161538461538461,Negative,l86uj1,l86uj1
ggn2pcp,I haven’t done a deep dive into the published studies but I’m assuming that those people who are determined to be protected were tested for antibodies? I wonder if the other ten percent are just slow developers with sluggish immune systems. Anything that would cause the illness to be mild like a cold would reduce the death toll tremendously. Pfizer has stated about 40% were non Caucasian subjects in the study. I think it’s imperative to continue research into those folks who seem to have the worst susceptibility. It seems that being of two races such as African American Blacks and mixed race indigenous people (mixed with Caucasian) have the worst outcomes. There are other factors of course poor diet and obesity being the most common comorbidities but the research is not really clear why these groups get sicker and die faster than lower income whites. It angers me when public figures get COVID and then preach about it being an equal opportunity disease. It’s not. It’s killing black and brown people at a far greater rate than white people. I too like you have a bit of public health background. I had to chose between a degree in public health or one in nursing administration so I opted for the masters in public health with a specific interest in diabetic education.

mfis3r,Delayed GI symptoms after 2nd Pfizer dose? My husband (23M) got his second Pfizer dose on 319. He felt the usual flu-like symptoms for the first 24 hours and then felt fine afterwards. However around day 4 or 5 after the 2nd shot he began having really bad lower abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea and has ever since(going on day 11). He’s also complained of tightness in his chest (particularly the left side). He’s a marathon runner (and his stomach issues aren’t the typical runner’s runs which he has experienced before as well) and has no history of asthma or other underlying health conditions. Has anyone else experienced any delayed onset of GI problems? Wondering at what point do we take him to a doctor.

No.  This was a difficult but necessary wager.  The government is not making the vaccine mandatory and scientists responded at record speed to try to save as many lives as possible.  Whether to ultimately take the vaccine is your choice under very difficult circumstances.Moreover allowing people to sue the vaccine creators would have likely delayed vaccine roll out.

lwn3ao,1st dose of Pfizer! Doing great so far. I wanted to share my positive experience so far since there seems to be a lot of negativity around the vaccines. I'm asian 20s and transgender. I have family history of heart disease but I am not taking any heart meds and am pretty healthy. I have also never tested positive for covid or had any covid symptoms so far. I got my vaccine this morning and went to work (pharmacy) right after.Initial shot: no worse than a flu shot. In fact I think the poke might even hurt less than a flu shot. Got it in my non-dominant arm and then sat around being observed for 15 minutes before I could leave. I had some initial anxiety going in (I generally have medical anxiety even though I work in healthcare lol). Besides the anxiety I felt fine so they let me leave after 15 minutes.1st hour after shot: I noticed some light tingling in my fingertips (just the middle 3 fingers) and it went away after a few minutes. I had a light headache around the back of my skullbehind my ears. Also felt a little sore at the injection site and some arm weakness.Throughout the day (working): my normal work day is walking around the pharmacy reaching up on shelves carrying sometimes heavy boxes typing on a computer counting pills doing some basic math answering phonestalking to people using a register etc. I was able to do all my normal work functions. I felt some minor arm weakness intermittently (not enough to prevent moving or using my arm) but otherwise didn't notice any other side effects while I was working.Evening: after I peeled off the bandaid I noticed the pad was pretty bloody so in my case I think I bled more from this shot than from a regular flu shot (could also be because I went to work and used my arm a lot right after). The injection site was of course no longer bleeding at this point. Now that I'm no longer at work I notice the muscle soreness in just my deltoid and I also have a light headache again but that might be dehydration because I skipped lunch during my shift.At the clinic the pharmacist who administered my shot told me that moving the arm around would reduce soreness overall. I think this is probably true. My muscle feels no more sore than if I did a mid-intensity work out so it's very manageable (I am not a regular exercise person). I was also told it's okay to take tylenol or ibuprofen after the shot but I have taken neither.I'll post an update if there's any strange developments but if not I'll do another post after I get my second shot :),kpoptech,2021-03-03 06:23:32+00:00,8.0,0.4729967496271842,0.1437711744776962,Positive,1,lwn3ao

If you’re really worried maybe give it an extra 10 and check in with your body every so often by standing up and walking around a bit. If you don’t feel light-headed nauseous or symptoms of allergies you’re good to go. My husband and I both got our shots at the same time and within a few minutes the soreness set in. Otherwise we were feeling totally charged until maybe 4-5 hours later when the fatigue set in. You’ll be fine driving for a couple hours after the shot for sure.

gjen75q,I got my first Pfizer dose last week and I also deal with anxiety issues. For me other then a sore arm I haven't had any other issues.I admit I am a bit nervous about the 2nd shot because there tend to be more side effects to it and I also have an autoimmune disease and take a biologic medication so it further complicates things.  To answer your question by not getting the 2nd shot you only get to 52% effectiveness based on everything I've found. Which still puts you at considerable risk of getting covid at some point. You have to do what feels right for you I have decided that while I am nervous about it I need to do this to not only protect myself but my family and friends. I know my anxiety won't be great after my 2nd shot but if I backed down everytime my anxiety got bad I would never move forward.

gjx63vy,&gt;s in specific populI felt the exact same way. I don't see covid patients every day but I do see a lot of patients for rehab who were never hospitalized and never had severe symptoms. These patients are also fairly young (&gt;40) but have difficulty carrying out every day tasks due to sever fatigue. In regards to the vaccine; I've only had my first dose and it was very mild. I had some fairly moderate pain in the arm I received the vaccine for about 24 hours but it resolved fairly quickly.  Bottom line is that the mildmoderate side effects from the vaccine are well worth the protection you receive from getting covid.

ly62nc,Have any of you been discriminated against when getting your first dose? So I’m in my 30s. I’m an essential worker in food &amp; agriculture and I’m getting my first vaccine tomorrow after work. 2 of my friends have gotten their first vaccines previously. One is in healthcare and the other is a teacher. They were both telling me their experiences of how the people administering the vaccines were discriminating against them because they’re young and kept drilling them and questioning their jobs even though they are both essential and was able to show them their work letter. Has this happened to anyone else? I guess I just don’t want to be discriminated against and turned away and if there’s a good chance that might happen I want to be prepared to stand up for myself if anything. Also has anyone in their 30s received their vaccines at CVS? If so what’s the experience like?,cvadh001,2021-03-05 06:43:17+00:00,23.0,0.3766666666666666,0.1758333333333333,Positive,1,ly62nc
lmsanr,Dad got first Pfizer Shot Friday. Fever 6 days later Hey guys I have some questions. I cant find any info on this. My dad is 65 and suffers from bad diabetes and kidney disease. He got the shot on the 12th. Everything was fine. 6 days later he has a 100degree fever and is having problems breathing. Getting the shot was the only time he came into contact with anybody. I figure its just side effects but google isnt helping me out here. Google only giving me 2nd shot side effects. Fyi right now hes getting an instant testIs 100degree fever and trouble breathing normal 6 days after the first shot?Would having the shot and experiencing side effects give a positive test result?If that is the case can you also be contagious from side effects from the shot?Thank you,Fun_Statement_8252,2021-02-18 17:36:48+00:00,12.0,0.4754112554112553,0.0053102453102453,Positive,1,lmsanr
meuvqw,2nd Pfizer dose experience and side effects [M21] I got my first dose in February. At first I didn’t even feel it and was wondering if I actually got the shot or not since it didn’t even pinch my arm like a regular vaccine. I had very minor body aches that disappeared overnight. I got my 2nd dose yesterday 7Pm at work. It definitely packed a punch. Usually I have a high pain tolerance so I avoid Painkillers. I was fine up until I woke up today and went to work. The pain in my arm is minimal but I started developing a fever headache Body aches and basically felt like shit the whole day. Just got back from work and I’m worse. It felt like a 20 hour shift and I couldn’t wait for my shift to be over.

gwcv432,Thanks for raising this point. I also have concerns about the long term effects of the vaccine because you can’t speed up that part (studying long term effects) of the clinical trials. I find it difficult to talk with people about the vaccine because the majority of them take a hard and fast stance for the vaccine which I can understand in a certain context but they do it in a way that makes the dissenting opinion sound absurd. Just want to note I likely will get the vaccine though it probably won’t be this year. I believe in the effectiveness of vaccines and I don’t believe in far fetched conspiracy theories. However I think it’s totally fair to have a healthy amount of skepticism when injecting something into your body and I believe each person is entitled to choices about their personal health. It’s a shame people can’t have conversations about topics like this without resorting to immaturity pettiness or just ignorance.,vallis_alps_,2021-04-29 22:53:03+00:00,,0.6295068027210885,0.0659013605442176,Positive,n1f58i,n1f58i

gqfwofc,Yesss exactly. You bring up good points here too. Pfizer and Moderna are said to be working on booster shots for the variants and J&amp;J is testing a 2-dose regimen (presumably for higher efficacy and updated formula for variants). How can we loosen up our regulations and become less careful when we know there are variants out there that are a legit cause of concern as seen by how these companies are making booster shots? I’m not saying that it has to be this way for ever but please wait until we at least have the booster shots for the variants.

ghrcvr5,"You could make that argument and on a philosophical level be correct but on a legalprocedural level the cause of death would be allergic reaction unless the person also happened to have covid while having a reaction to the vaccine AND covid was implicated in making it more likely that they died from that allergic reaction.What does and does not get put on a death certificate is not arbitrary and it's not new and the implications of each are carefully thought out and have been since long before Covid was a thing.  If you have a condition and that condition is part of the REASON you were more susceptible to dying of something else it makes sense to report that condition as a contributing cause.  The fact that something contributed to making you weaker and more susceptible to death by the actual cause of death doesn't mean the ACTUAL cause of the death wasn't the ACTUAL cause of death.  It just means that maybe if you weren't obese or didn't have diabetes or didn't have cancer or heart disease or one of several other contributing factors you MIGHT have had a better chance at surviving the covid that was still the thing that killed you.  It makes sense to collect that information but the fact is if no one cared about what made you weaker we could certainly justify only listing covid as the ONLY cause of death for all these folks.  And for what it's worth you could make a compelling case that some people are currently dying who wouldn't under ordinary circumstances because they aren't seeking treatment or can't GET treatment for conditions totally unrelated to Covid.  And the fact that COVID is the reason they can't get treatment means morally and philosophically covid is the cause.  Their death certificates won't reflect that though.  It's just that more information is always better when figuring out what our greatest public health threats are so collecting all the information about contributing causes makes sense.In the end it's a wasted argument when it comes to the vaccine though because the vaccine isn't killing anyone.  It may very well at some point.  There will be a small number of people who leave too quickly AND have a negative reaction AND are by themselves and unable to get help probably.  It's reasonable to expect that.  But it will be so few as to render a discussion as to whether to judge that death ""covid related"" pointless.  Morally and philosophically I agree that it is.  But legally and procedurally it won't be counted that way.",Reneeisme,2021-01-01 21:02:59+00:00,,0.4156697931697932,0.0575986050986051,Positive,ghr1ldj,kni32j

mgcg6e,"First Dose of Pfizer Vaccine Experience Hey! Ive been lurking this subreddit for the past week now after scheduling my appointments for the two doses of the pfizer vaccine and I thought Id share my personal experience do far! Hopefully thisll break up the sea of anxiety swirling around this subreddit.March 28th - the appointment My appointment was on March 28th at 1pm! My partner and I (a couple of healthy 27 year olds) both had our appointments set up for this time and both got seated at around 12:45-12:50ish (we came nice and early) My actual jab was around 1pm about 5ish mins after my partner. Immediately we both felt odd sensations down our arm and overall jitters from the experience its hard to say if the weird feeling was just nervousness or not. I was feeling some mild anxiety and he was doing a bit better on that front. Of the two of us hes typically the type to feel weird nervousness around shots and stuff so it wasnt out of the ordinary. All he had to report was an oddly dry mouth.about 2-3pm I started to feel slight soreness in my arm. He didnt feel anything. We hung out together for a bit and then took naps (we were up earlier than we usually are for our appointments lol) I remember my arm starting to feel pretty sore by the time I was cozied up in bed and when I woke up from said nap my arm felt like itd been punched.For the rest of the day there wasnt really anything to report. Neither of us felt all that particularly tired. We had normal meals. Took our medications for the day. It wasnt until much later sometime at night maybe closer to midnight (anywhere from 11pm-3am because i literally cannot remember) that my partner started to feel what he described as ""that feeling you get when you know youre about to wake up sick as hell tomorrow"" and he went to sleep it off. When he woke up again he felt 100%March 29th:Absolutely nothing too interesting to report for the majority of the the day! My arm was sore still but not as sore as the day before my partner was feeling 100%. I did experience an odd burning mouth sensation first thing in the day when i ate my breakfast of yogurt and berries. It was as if I had just eaten spicy food but the and the entire right side of my mouth was on fire. After some googling though I couldnt conclude whether it was due to the vaccine or just because of the other plethora of conditions Ive got that could cause it. We went grocery shopping came home and did our usual routines  around the apartment. Neither of us were tired or all that ill feeling and by early evening the sore feeling in my arm was completely gone. Around 11pm12am though I started to feel really weird fatigue which isnt too unusual considering I get horrible sleep. But this was a bit different because my arms and legs felt very mildly achey - and when I say mildly I mean VERY mild like enough that I noticed it while sitting down and crocheting but not enough that when I got up to do something else real quick that it got in the way at all. I just felt kind of off and perhaps a bit malaise. I settled into bed assuming Id sleep the rest of the night even though Id been going to bed around 3am the past few nights. I ended up waking up 2 hours later and felt perfectly normal again! Not sure if it was a side effect of the vaccine or an anxiety induced sensation that started the moment my arms felt a little sore from crocheting. Anyway! Thats it so far. Its currently 6am on the 30th. If anything changes Ill be sure to update :)",tombstoned69,2021-03-30 10:00:01+00:00,3.0,0.5451678876678875,-0.0020047313797313,Negative,1,mgcg6e

gqxcvz8,Many viruses contain spike proteins so that alone is not the cause of blood blotting issues. Influenza is a spike protein virus and we don’t see strokes with the flu. So it’s not the spike protein itself that does the damage but the actual virus genetic code. But I’m not sure anyone understands what causes it honestly. I don’t have any links but if you Google spike protein in other viruses you’ll see many viruses contain them. Hope this helped. PS. I have been vaccinated. I feel the risk of the vaccine is less than the risk of covid infection so I took the lesser of two evils in my opinion.,jcnlb,2021-03-14 18:47:32+00:00,,0.4788194444444444,0.1322916666666666,Positive,m50f3n,m50f3n

gli6km3,It works how normal mRNA works in the body. Carrying genetic code to tell your body to make a protein. In this instance the protein is a spiked protein which your body identifies as harmful and this message gives an instruction then the cells will destroy that protein. Virus with a 99.99% survival rate. Vaccine is 80-90% effective. Take care of your body and have a healthy immune system and you don’t have to worry. This vaccine is basically pointless. I assume it will have similar effects to how Bill Gates last vaccine trial went. He did a trial of polio vaccine which left hundreds of thousand infertile harmed or dead.,_huntah,2021-01-31 18:33:37+00:00,,0.3685185185185185,0.0666666666666666,Positive,glhoz24,l8v8k5

giebf5h,From the New England Journal of Medicine Pfizer trial paper: “The cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients begins to diverge by 12 days after the first dose 7 days after the estimated median viral incubation period of 5 days10 indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. The study was not designed to assess the efficacy of a single-dose regimen. Nevertheless in the interval between the first and second doses the observed vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 52% and in the first 7 days after dose 2 it was 91% reaching full efficacy against disease with onset at least 7 days after dose 2. Of the 10 cases of severe Covid-19 that were observed after the first dose only 1 occurred in the vaccine group. This finding is consistent with overall high efficacy against all Covid-19 cases. The severe case split provides preliminary evidence of vaccine-mediated protection against severe disease alleviating many of the theoretical concerns over vaccine-mediated disease enhancement.”,410bore,2021-01-07 05:49:34+00:00,,0.3579924242424242,0.1310227272727272,Positive,ks4dpz,ks4dpz

I have come in close contact with people who have had Covid at the time or just for over it and were testing positive and still have not caught (that I know of). I also know many people who live with loved ones that haven’t caught Covid even if one of them living with them did have it.

We know the Queen and her family received the vaccines already but they did not let us know which vaccines they had.If they really want to encourage people they should let us know.Of course it is likely that this royal family all received Pfizer and therefore they did not dare to disclose.

We know that AstraZeneca is cheaper and the UK government want to promote it as a 'national miracle'. It would be wonderful if the Royal Family received it.

lm8nv1,Pfizer 1st Shot I received my first Pfizer dose last week.  I am in the Midwest so had my winter parka on after the shot was administered as I waited for the 15 minute observation period. About 10 minutes after the shot I got a rush or warmth over my body concentrating in my lower abdomen.  I then had a tingly feeling on the roof of my mouth.  I got help and was monitored for an hour.  No medicine was administered vitals stayed normal.  The mouth feeling went away almost immediately.  The burning sensation also subsided quickly.  I got in my car to go home the seat heat started warming up and the burning sensation in my abdomen returned.  After that I only had arm soreness at the vaccine site for one day.  I talked to my GP and allergist and neither have heard of anyone having the burning sensation.  They said to get the second shot.  They referred to it as an adverse reaction not an allergic reaction.  Still very nervous for my second dose.  I have to bring a support person and stay for an hour long observation again.,ofthegardens,2021-02-18 00:07:01+00:00,1.0,0.361111111111111,0.0981481481481481,Positive,1,lm8nv1

kitnba,How many people can get vaccinated? Genuine question. I don’t seem to be able to piece the information together. I am trying to figure out how many doses of the vaccine have been secured by the US. We started with 100 million diesel of Pfizer secured and just secured 100 million more by the end of July. Then 10 million Moderna by the end of 2020 but how much more Moderna can we expect and when?With a roughly 330 million person population it looks like we have enough for about 13 of the population to receive both doses. More Moderna could change this but does anyone have numbers on that? I’m curious about when we have enough to get to 70% of the population so that we can get to some level of herd immunity.Thanks!,AmbienNoodle,2020-12-23 14:04:01+00:00,1.0,0.5477272727272727,0.2909090909090909,Positive,1,kitnba

gehu0bn,"If this were the black death the people would be demanding a vaccine and blaming their government for letting them die by the millions. They would be fighting over a spot for the vaccine because life is generally better than death.There is a real solid chance mathematically that you are alive today as a direct result of a vaccine. Being forced to take it shouldn't even be an issue. That's just being stubborn because you can be and risking your life while you do it.It's like those idiots who walk around town with their assault rifles to provoke the cops into a response so they can affirm their rights to do so. Yes they are legally right but it's still risking their life to prove a point.The real question is.. What part about taking the vaccine has you worried? Vaccination is proven to work beyond a doubt through history and no one can deny that.I think that the government should mandate that all vaccinations for pandemic like events be required. Because it's not only your life you are risking its others around you.The government also demands that you drive the speed limit. By your logic this is the government telling you what you can and can't do with your body and property. One person not getting vaccinated goes to the gas station and everyone else who want vaccinated because ""I got rights"" could end up catching it and dieing. This could lead to hundreds more deaths because ""I got rights"". This isn't you just risking your life. It's you risking other people's lives.I personally believe that anyone who refuses to take it.. If that's an option should be held accountable at that point for who they infect. If contact tracing traces an infection back to you.. And that spread killed 15 people.. That should be 15 counts of manslaughter.So if that was an option.. Like..

gi5pgfo,I’ve been a clinical researcher for 13 years.  I’ve worked on dozens of drugs- some FDA approved now.  Some not.  My main concern is the lack of longer term adverse event data.  In trials we track patients side effects for sometimes years.  For chemo we track them until they pass away.   My other main concern is the actual researchers and how they collect the data. I’ve trained a number of researchers and I very often see a lack of patient education on how to report side effects.  Most patients try to weed out their own side effects and only report those that they think might be resulting from the research.  This means they don’t report items that they assume aren’t related.  For example a patient will say to me I had a horrible headache but it’s because I didn’t sleep well.  If patients aren’t educated to report everything — important data is missed.,risareese,2021-01-05 07:06:05+00:00,,0.5765151515151515,0.0825757575757575,Positive,kqieo5,kqieo5

kjwyo7,"Vaccinated Symbol? I apologize in advance if I'm posting to the wrong sub. Has any thought been put into some obvious outward symbol to show someone has recieved the covid vaccine? (arm band ribbon bumber sticker on forehead)If not I'm thinking black bandana or arm band over the arm that was injected (easy enough people  would do it odd enough to draw attention and specifically black to recognize those that died or have life altering health complications from covid). This idea took me less time than writing this post! Please somebody come up with something better!I know this sounds silly now depending on where you live but I think it's necessary in some places.  I live in the US in an apartment complex housing a few anti-maskers (covid deniers) and a lot of people who wear masks on their chins (like why even bother?)I have high hopes of getting both doses of a covid vaccine in the next 3 to 24 months (US politicians have been wrong a lot recently) but after I'm vaccinated and maskless I don't want people to think ""Oh we got that mask wearing fool on our side I'll never get the vaccine!!!""I'm also not particularly against continuing to wear a mask AFTER  I'm fully vaccinated for solidarity with the not yet vaccinated and to keep being the mask wearing fool my neighbors make fun off. But I (and others?) would appreciate a simple recognizable symbol of being vaccinated.For anyone wondering the covid vaccines (plural) have been proven to work or else governmental health agencies wouldn't be distributing them (they could have been injecting us with bleach in March if they just wanted to kill their citizens).Please don't argue with me about if the vaccines work or masks are effective or if covid is real.

Not bad just annoying and a bit uncomfortable. I assumed I picked up my backpack wrong and pulled something the wrong way in my armpit.

gsnl0v2,"I have to disagree with you on your point.The main goal of the covid vaccines is to activate an immune response against the spike part of COVID viruses. The mRNA instructs your cells to produce JUST the spike and results in the creation of antibodies that will be present in your body that would actively look for the covid spike and activate a response against the real virus. &amp; x200B;The main reason this is beneficial is that your body gets to ""practice"" taking out the Covid virus without getting the full virus which DOES ""hack"" your cells to produce more COVID viruses. This is not good because the virus spreads while your body has to learn how to fight the real Covid virus and can cause significantly more damage in the long run. The current covid vaccines do seem to be safe to take as a lot of time effort and money has gone into developing these vaccines. My family (and myself) have all been able to receive the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and have been ok. Taking a cost-benefit analysis of whether you should take the vaccine is a great idea. Being skeptical is good as well I was not going to receive the vaccine a few months ago but have decided that there more benefits than any drawbacks and got my first Moderna dose on friday.&amp; x200B;People should not call you names for expressing your opinion although a tinfoil hat does sound like something fun to wear XD thanks for expressing your opinion.

kfqthf,Mom's vaccine experience My mom doesn't use reddit but she works for a hospital and was able to get the first shot of the pfizer vaccine yesterday so I figured I'd give updates.For information my Mom turns 60 this Monday only has one kidney and is a overweight but she goes swimming nearly everyday for exercise. So she's not the healthiest person but also not extremely unhealthy either. She got it around 6pm 121720 and had no side effects upon receiving it. She came home and we had a normal night and she went to bed like usual around 9pm. She has Fridays off but usually wakes up around 6am and goes to the pool around 7am. Today she slept in until 9am and woke up to tell me she felt sick kind of like she had the flu and was going to skip the pool and go back to bed. It's currently just past noon and she's still sleeping. Planning on pushing lots of fluids today but it seems like she's overall fine just having a harder reaction than most. I'll update on this post over the next several days.Edit: 3:42 pm CSTMom is up and watching TV. Her arm still hurts really bad she says but she's not as nauseous and dizzy. She's drinking lots of water and joking around so I think the worst is over. She's a bit grumpy about her arm but overall doing good.,avalonrose14,2020-12-18 18:35:56+00:00,16.0,0.4383540372670808,-0.0064182194616977,Negative,1,kfqthf

gpp0h5j,The bad news is that the answer generally is yes.  Here is a clip from a video I did that discusses transmission after vaccination: [However this was made before we had any data on the Pfizer vaccine's ability to block transmission.  Echoing uLotusElise research is emerging from Israel (where 23 of the population is vaccinated) that the Pfizer vaccine is highly effective at reducing transmission.  But there is still uncertainty.  And one of worst case scenarios remains an overconfident vaccinated super-spreader that doesn't realize (because they are asymptomatic) that they are spreading COVID-19.  It's all to say that it's a balance.  You are at significantly less risk of getting infected or transmitting.  But that risk isn't zero.  So you should act accordingly.,COVID_VacciNATION,2021-03-04 20:30:47+00:00,,0.6722222222222222,-0.3277777777777778,Negative,lxq3ix,lxq3ix

gst8jhd,Well technically as with every other vaccine it takes a minimum of 2 weeks for you to become immune because it takes some time for your body to build antibodies. My company is just being as cautious as possible due to us working with a children who generally are more likely to be immunocompromised. I'm actually the first one in the company who has had to quarentine within those 2 weeks. I was just curious if there was any research done on the rates of people getting sick within those 2 weeks of getting the vaccine.,sandsnatchqueen,2021-03-30 15:49:03+00:00,,0.5582251082251082,-0.024025974025974,Negative,gssx158,mg6fec

giw4dmd,It probably doesn't make much difference for you.  If you were around your husband in the day or two before he got the test you've probably been exposed and the vaccine hasn't had enough time to ramp up your immune system to fight it off.  It shouldn't hurt anything but there's just not been enough time for it to help much either. If by some chance you weren't exposed or weren't exposed to enough virus to catch it every day that goes by before you ARE exposed improves the amount that the vaccine can help you.  The vaccine is basically telling your immune system to get ready for this invader and it does get ready a little more every day.  As far as how effective it is I believe I read that after 15 days the first shot is 52% effective at boosting your immune system enough to mean you won't become ill if your immune system encounters the real virus.  (That's off the top of my head though don't quote me).  But that's because after 15 days your immune system has had the full ability to react to the information in that vaccine dose and get ready.  If your husband was exposing you before you even got the vaccine or shortly after there just wasn't enough time to react to the vaccine before your body had to start reacting to the real thing.,Reneeisme,2021-01-11 15:44:29+00:00,,0.5204710144927537,0.1434782608695652,Positive,kv3p7z,kv3p7z

lsryyu,Received Pfizer vaccine while stoned question Ok this is crazy  — I took an edible around 3pm got really high then passed out and woke up around 5:30pm to an urgent text from a friend. A local vaccination site had much lower turnout than expected and a bunch of extra defrosted vaccines needed to be put into arms or they would go to waste when the site closed at 6:30pm. They were taking anyone who showed up before 6:30pm. It sounded way too good to be true but I  jammed over there anyway and miraculously got the first dose all the while I couldn’t believe it was actually happening because I was still a little high! It wasn’t ideal nor would I have ever chosen to get high right before taking the vaccine but the timing of the unexpected opportunity was what it was so I shot my shot. So my question is and I have no idea if there is anyone on here who is even qualified to answer this — will being high while I received the vaccine shot have any contraindications with the vaccine or make it any less effective?

My lab gives out the actual CT values for each of the three tested sequences (N E and RdRp genes in our case) as well as the final interpretation of the results. So a strong to medium strong  positive signal for all three genes (CT value between 15 and low 30s) would indicate a recent and probably still ongoing infection). Things get a little less certain with lower viral RNA concentrations (high CT values) as it’s not that easy to determine the cause of low viral RNA concentration (could be a badly taken swab something going wrong with RNA isolation PCR inhibition very early pre-symptomatic infection or a 2-3 week (or even months) old infection that went undetected).,Tommy-X,2021-01-17 22:43:03+00:00,,0.509549062049062,0.0158736171236171,Positive,gjngbqy,kyeyrq

I thought the whole point behind having the antibodies after getting the virus was that IF your body was exposed to it again it would recognize it and attack it. But you probably wouldn’t even know or show symptoms of being sick. I thought that if you had the antibodies you would be protected from the virus even getting far enough to cause your immune system to create symptoms for you to feel sick.

Science gets it wrong all the damn time and various medicines that are deemed a miracle today are often yanked off the market or severely restricted tomorrow.I don't think the vaccine contains anything purposefully harmful but it was only tested for 3 months and not for the multiple years it would normally take. Not to mention the big pharma companies developing these emergency use vaccines have been given immunity from our government should the shots go sideways and do mare harm than good. Nobody knows how successful the vaccines will be or what (if any) long term side effects people will have from them.

gqbivvi,Well from my standpoint you are a minor and it would be your parents decision. Now if they are letting you choose I would say that’s up to you and a huge burden for you to decide. However during trials participants were 16 and older so your age group has been studied and approved if that is your concern. I will tell you if I had a 17 year old in this situation I would absolutely want my child to get vaccinated. I would be heartbroken if my child was seriously ill or heaven forbid died as a result of me not allowing it. Sure there are risks. But there are risks with not getting it too. As a mom I would prefer taking action instead of hoping for the best. As a grandma I will be hoping my grandkids are vaccinated as soon as they are allowed. My grandkids are my world and a friend of mine just last week had to deal with their 4 year old grandkid being hospitalized due to seizures from Covid. Terrifying if you ask me. My vote is yes.

Joints hurt back hurt my head felt heavy. Woke up on the 29th with a head ache and worse body aches than the night before. Then the chills kicked in and a fever that was just there to let me sweat and then freeze sweat and then freeze all day long. Cold hands hot feet inability to regulate body temp. My nostrils began to burn like I was only breathing cold dry air for a week. A tickle in my chest?? A pressure? Then a productive cough with a sore throat. After a whole day of this I took 1000 mg of Tylenol and slept 9 hours. The next day was the 30th no fever. Little cough. Little chest pressureitch.

gsjeykp,"""97% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases"" - does this mean those who got COVID after vax had no symptoms? How many caught COVID after vax? My question is how do we know without the vax these people would be asymptomatic COVID anyway? I live in Singapore where we had severe outbreak in foreign worker's dormitories and out of 52k detected infections no one really had any symptoms as far as I know. The reason we knew about the 52k infections was because we tested 300k of them. Can it be possible that a high percentage of COVID is generally asymptomatic? Is there a control group? ""94% effective against asymptomatic infection"" - this means that those who got COVID after vax did not have symptoms hence did not infect those around them who were not vaxxed? So 6% of those vaxxed still infected others? If so then this is a good outcome.

gh49fpk,"Just want to interject that your ""reaction"" consists of your immune system's reaction to a fakedead virus that doesn't replicate and keep hitting your system with more and more of what's provoking a reaction.  So if you're worried about having a bad reaction just consider that any reaction you have is a mini version of what would happen if your system encountered the actual virus.  And the worse it is the worse your real immune response would be and that immune response would last weeks and keep increasing in size as more and more virus replicated in your system.Significant reactions to vaccines happen sometimes and they aren't pleasant but they are all the more reason to want your immune system to be prepared to deal with the real thing quickly.",Reneeisme,2020-12-27 00:08:43+00:00,,0.4714285714285715,0.1761904761904762,Positive,kksqum,kksqum

They arewere leaders both Trump and Biden. They lead by example by showing the country that it's important to be vaccinated. Look at your senators they've been vaccinated too. so why exactly does it matter ?  easy resources. they have the entire country's resource at their hands at that time to ensure that they have the latest most updated information (and accurate) about the vaccine and enough behind them to make an informed decision to take the vaccine and not die from it like you claim. 2.9 million vaccinated so far how many adverse reaction to you have ? let's say the vaccine is 99.999% safe for administration you'd have 290 sob stories. go look up and count if you have many dying because the vaccine killed them. No. you don't. i checked.   now tell me when's the last time you have anything in life that's 99.999% guaranteed ? your phone ? your PC ? your car startup ? nope they all fall short. don't be dumb don't be a sheep. it's science for a reason.,kennese2007,2021-03-09 03:49:33+00:00,,0.5325000000000001,0.1116666666666666,Positive,gqabwd8,m0rcxf

That left me with a scar in the lung. I have since then recovered and even though the breathing isnt back to 100% I could exercise in the gym and live normally.I got the covid vaccine from Pfizer dose 1 about 10 days ago. Had fever chills fatigue which resolved in a day. But the fatigue even though it got better on the 4th day my energy levels arent back to normal..I cant walk without feeling dizzy. A couple of days ago I started having some effort with breathing as well. I have been monitoring my oxygen levels (98-99%) and heart rate. I went to the urgent care where the rapid covid test was negative and PCR test results are awaited. They asked me to rest and checked my breathing which seemed okay to them..they said they have nothing so work with as vitals are okay. IHas anyone faced similar effects from the vaccine?

Only infants and the elderly ever die of tetanus in the US and that's because they have either never been vaccinated or the immunity in the elderly has worn off.   If you're getting a booster shot there's no reason you can't wait a year or two.   On the other hand the chances of getting covid are much higher and the possibility of severe disease (or passing it on to someone else) is much higher than tetanus.They will not let you get the second dose of the covid vaccine if you've had another vaccine weeks earlier.,enya_at_law,2021-04-01 03:39:36+00:00,,0.4791666666666667,0.0625,Positive,mhh0x3,mhh0x3

My arm hurt so bad I barely moved it for 48 hours but at least that one took a little longer to kick in. This time my arm hurt immediately. Not sure if the nurse jabbed my muscle incorrectly or what but I noticed muscle tenderness right away. I felt fine until I woke up around 4:30 am (13 hours post-vaccine) with the chills and chest tightness. I have asthma and anything foreign makes me feel a bit wheezy so that wasn’t too startling but the flu-like symptoms came up around 8:00 AM even after taking 400mg ibuprofen. I’m pretty sure I have a fever because I have body aches that come in waves along with major skin sensitivity (my clothes hurt against it). I’m pretty fatigued but nothing has happened with my stomach appetite is normal.

My arm has been a lot more sore from the second dose so I rolled up my sleeve to look at it and my arm is completely swollen red and hot to the touch near the injection site and bruised all around it. This did not happen with the first dose. I have several conditions many autoimmune. So I'm not that suprised but a little worried.The packet they sent home with me says...In most cases discomfort from fever or pain is normal. Conta t your doctor:* If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours.* if your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days.My clinic was closed today but if my arm isn't any less swollen red tender or bruised tomorrow should I contact them?

gmvsayq,This is what the VAERS Guide to interpreting data says:“When evaluating data from VAERS it is important to note that for any reported event no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event... Reports vary in quality and completeness. They often lack details and sometimes can have information that contains errors.”Just because someone died after taking a vaccine doesn’t mean they died because of the vaccine. Some of the reports in that article literally said they didn’t think the death was because of the vaccine and lots of the people has many other conditionsdiseases already. Maybe read an article before you post it.,BwayMets,2021-02-11 00:34:04+00:00,,0.6660714285714285,0.0660714285714285,Positive,gmvrvss,lgzshv

And like 95% effective against getting symptomatic infection compared to the placebo group which makes it like around 98% effective or something very close to 100% but not quite. So basically there will be a few people who will get sick but only mildly. They believe this is likely due to a poor immune response to the vaccine because everyone immune function is different. And they are not sure about asymptomatic infection yet since that was not studied. But they believe it will prevent that as well based on the decline in infection rates currently.,jcnlb,2021-03-16 14:56:40+00:00,,0.644359410430839,0.0460034013605441,Positive,gr4f67s,m5w856

gi3hjes,You’re missing a few things. First is that mRNA degrades after translation so it doesn’t linger in the body. Second it doesn’t change the genetic code of your cells. The body learns to synthesize the spike protein from the mRNA but it’s a translation that isn’t forever and doesn’t become part of your cell’s library (so to speak). In other words without the mRNA in your bloodstream your cells don’t remember how to build the spike protein. However once the spike protein is made your body recognizes it as an antigen again because the actual genetic code to make the protein is not in your cell’s library and creates antibodies to it. Your cells will remember how to build those antibodies.,NotQuiteStableGenius,2021-01-04 19:12:40+00:00,,0.1597222222222222,-0.0458333333333333,Negative,gi3c6s9,kqd81v

lq6q1u,worried about getting 2nd moderna dose tomorrow Due for my 2nd Moderna dose tomorrow and worried about having a weird auto-immune response to it. After the 1st dose I had arm soreness and felt pretty sick for about 12 hours but then I was fine until a few days later I noticed these weird painful blisterssores that showed up all at once on my hands. They still haven't gone away after 4 weeks and I can't find anything online that matches what they look and feel like (they are definitely not normal blisters I'm certain of that. The closest description I could find online was for chilblains which they might actually be.) I'm also having constant IBS symptoms that I've never experienced before. These two things might be totally unrelated but as a totally healthy 28 yr old with no underlying medical issues no medications and no past experiences like this an auto immune reaction to the vaccine is starting to seem plausible. I've had several drug sensitivities in the past including rashes and once anaphylaxis from an antibiotic. Now I've gotten myself all psyched out about getting the 2nd dose. Does anyone have advice or similar experiences?

I am a 45 YO woman with preexisting conditions and teacher. 1st vaccine: Very sore arm some fatigue and slight headache starting about 5 hours after vaccine2nd vaccine: Felt fine for the first few hours arm started getting sore from the get go. Later on in the evening I was cold and could not warm up. The next day I felt miserable. My head was hurting my body ached I had chills and a fever. I dragged myself home from work and went to sleep right after. Today I woke up fine. No more side effects. My arm is still sore though and itchy. I hope that was the worst of it.Overall I am happy that I got it and very thankful.,Previous-Criticism45,2021-02-03 22:06:18+00:00,1.0,0.4352130325814536,-0.0367167919799498,Negative,1,lbzper

You could hold an ice pack on your shoulder for that time period until you got back to the nurse. I'm sure it would help to not feel it but honestly I didn't feel a thing. I then had to wait 15 minutes to see if there were any immediate side effects.,dontwontcarequeend65,2021-03-03 22:51:05+00:00,,0.5412698412698412,0.3119047619047618,Positive,gpkue45,lx2nhk

gibne3e,Eh just go if you bothered to sign up for it and work closely with a lot of risk groups. I hope you don't have anything important to do at work or elsewhere the coming week. You can expect a lot more side effects than any vaccine you've ever had before and having to call in sick is a very real possibility. The talk about still transmitting the virus despite neutralizing antibodies makes absolutely no sense. It's the same bullshit talk of early spring that natural immunity happens in no one. It's a meme repeated by a public who likes to loudly posture and demand conformity without any understanding of any of the mechanisms behind well anything at all. An old vinyl player stuck repeating the same soundbites. The way I see it transmission load is so high in general society that vaccinating healthcare staff will not make much of a dent in total case load it might make a slight difference in deaths if we assume that the transmission chain for elderly usually is through healthcare system but that's conjecture. Where the vaccine will do the most difference is in the actual at risk groups so it should be given by age in descending order. Once death counts drop the political underpinning is no longer there for lockdowns and we can stop the emotional fearmongering media circus and start measuring the damage they have done both in lives lost to nonpandemic causes and economic damage and line the lawsuits up.,vivehelpme,2021-01-06 17:31:22+00:00,,0.4300198412698412,0.0432936507936508,Positive,krq4na,krq4na

gn1thsk,My 70 year old sister had a mild case of Covid 4 months ago and got her first Pfizer shot 12 days ago. She started not feeling well a few hours after (flu-ish type symptoms) and was flat out sick for the next two days and couldn't get out of bed. She has a friend who lives in her building who is a 95 YO man who just got a sore arm. She is totally freaked and afraid to get the second one. It sounds like she may do better with  2 then she did with  1. I get my second Moderna shot next Thursday and I must admit I'm a bit nervous to say the least. All you can do is prepare as best you can and hope for the best. Stay well everyone.Note: I just got a sore arm for about 36 hours with the first shot.,S_NJ_Guy,2021-02-12 12:02:15+00:00,,0.3293417366946778,0.0937675070028011,Positive,lhzoqj,lhzoqj

To prepare for my second dose I started taking tumeric supplements a few weeks leading up to my second appt and made sure I was on it with my daily vitamins.  I drank fresh juices everyday throughout the week prior to my appointment and stayed extremely hydrated.  The morning of my second dose I drank a liquid IV (hydration+electrolyte replenisher) drank a ton of regular water another liquid IV right before the shot another after and continued to drink a ton of water throughout the day and the following day.  Evening of the shot I experienced minor chills.  Next day I woke up feeling very achy run down and tired.  Developed a headache in the afternoon. Continued to hydrate and took a nice nap.  All symptoms aside from a sore arm started to dissipate around 5 or 6pm (appx 28-30 hours after the second dose).,Beezhavekneez,2021-03-08 15:40:30+00:00,,0.314695454118531,0.0764804639804639,Positive,m06543,m06543

Sorry but you are totally wrong Coleman is a genuine empathetic man who has done fantastic work to break the corrupt forces in this world. 'Conspiracy theorist' is doublespeak for 'critical thinker'.Throughout the last year he has made a collection of videos that using only facts have ripped apart this scamdemic rubbish. He's one of the good guys no doubt.I could go to Bill Gates's Wikipedia entry and it only sings his praises and accomplishments. The truth however is not recorded there and it is that he is as much a philanthropist as J D Rockefeller was and has only left a trail of destruction and death in third world countries through his Planned Parenthood cloaked eugenicist organisation. That he's a demonstrable psychopath is not recorded there but it's true nevertheless.

gsqtjih,No I'm not denying there's a pathogen that they call 'Covid' out there! People who are denying the existence of that are muddying the waters in fact. I think that the psychopaths who are responsible for Operation Covid had to put something out there with enough potency to convince people of a real virus so they could do what they've doing for the last year. The scam part of it is that their controlled media has exaggerated it's strength and the death numbers and based on that declared a pandemic when there was not one. The CDC and NHS in the UK also admitted something that we knew very early on...that the PRC tests still being used and seen as the gold standard are not supposed to be used for diagnosis purposes. They sent millions of healthy people for inefficient tests just so that the false positives could drive on this deceitful narrative.The vaccine companies are supplying the toxin and are complicit but the culling has been pre-planned for a long time by the international superclass for whom depopulation has been a project for a long time.,ManofManySorrows,2021-03-29 23:39:12+00:00,,0.3922222222222223,0.0024999999999999,Positive,gsql8ja,mfx9hf

If natural immunity won’t work how will a vaccine?Like from what I read the thought is getting the virus doesnt make you immune because your body won’t remember the antibody for a mild caseBut that’s exactly how a vaccine works- isn’t it?From Googling: A vaccine works by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens either viruses or bacteria. To do this certain molecules from the pathogen must be introduced into the body to trigger an immune response.If anyone could educate me on this I would greatly appreciate it- thank you!!,casualoverreactor,2020-06-18 02:17:30+00:00,3.0,0.5339285714285714,0.2997023809523809,Positive,1,hb5omo

On social media I've seen a huge amount of people ripping into the FDA documents of the trials and painting a worrisome picture of side effect rates and heaps of people describing how the vaccine hits like a truck which doesn't really make it sound like something you pick up while doing grocery shoppingThe general atmosphere is that the vaccine side effects is a serious worry not so much worries about the vaccine being ineffective.Ironically it's the pro-vaccination camp that spreads misinformation about the vaccine not being preventive against disease transmission in order to justify further mask usage lockdowns and distancing.,vivehelpme,2021-01-15 17:13:41+00:00,,0.4374458874458875,0.124025974025974,Positive,gjcs12j,kxco7g

l2x4ls,Moderna 2nd Dose - Heart Palpitations I just received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine 4 hours ago.  5 minutes after I felt my heart racing and became very jittery.  It felt like I was almost going to pass out.  The EMS was called over and they checked my heart rate and blood pressure.  115bmp and 14080.  They re-did the blood pressure test since it was a trainee that had performed it and it came back 12080 so they just monitored me for a while.  I drank some water and put a candy in my mouth in case it was low blood sugar or just my nerves and was able to compose myself and check-out.  As soon as I got home I laid in bed and began cycling through cold and hot spells which lasted a good 2 12 hours.   After this I was able to get up and sit at my computer but my heart keeps racing with even walking to another room (110 bpm as I sit at my computer and type this).  Have any of you all experienced heart palpitations after the vaccine? and did it go away soon after?,icantrememberagainx3,2021-01-22 21:10:08+00:00,2.0,0.4727272727272728,0.2136363636363636,Positive,1,l2x4ls

After my first shot I don’t think I had any symptoms other than general fatigue but I also happened to get my period that day (tmi) so I don’t know how much of my cramping and fatigue that day and the next was from the vaccine vs my cycle.After getting my second dose I felt fine for a few hours. However I had a slight fever later in the day but it passed quickly and I felt fine when going to bed. Today I feel very tired my left arm hurts a bit and I am sore. The best way to describe how I feel is it’s like I did a hard workout yesterday and then got drunk at night and am now suffering from muscle fatigue and a minor hangover. No fever today and I’m definitely functional.

gpg6z5x,&gt;may impact my future children I assume you're a woman. Well the data is missing too little time for it to accumulate. So everything is assumption and in todays climate loaded with fear I wouldn't say assumptions are very reliable.On a purely theoretical basis the mRNA should be long gone and the spike antibodies shouldn't be any worse than what a normal covid infection would give you. But history is full of corpses of people that according to contemporary theory should've survived what in practice killed them and that is the very reason for lengthy clinical trials being a thing with followups continuing long after medicine is on the market too.&gt; Why are some people not choosing to get it?  As many reasons as there's people. A lot of people are young and face very little risk from covid itself and might never even be exposed to the disease so why then bother with a vaccine that can be an unpleasant experience?Some other people subscribe to literally every conspiracy theory that the internet have produced and don't even believe covid-19 is a thing. Me? Might get the vaccine sooner or later but I feel I'm constantly being lied to by the powers that be which isn't very conductive to exposing myself to experimental vaccines with emergency authorization. Reading the reported potential side effects within a 28 day window of vaccination also paints a picture of a generally unsafe vaccine(liver failure heart failure paralysis kidney failure everything failure and including death). Obviously a lot of things happen within a 28 day span that isn't the fault of the vaccine yet still are reported for the purpose of investigation but the same line of reasoning can be applied to covid itself. So my feeling is that I'm subject to barrage of institutional lies motivated by politics. And that society in general is in a state that will be mentioned on this page: [ a few years down the line. I'm an MD by the way so it's not that medicine and infectious disease is a foreign topic full of strange terms that I don't understand it's just that the politization ideology and fear have made it impossible to discern the actual truth value of any statement or study.,vivehelpme,2021-03-02 19:37:29+00:00,,0.3880555555555557,-0.0767534722222222,Negative,lw80xh,lw80xh

lnjh4t,How to get vaccine for u.s. ex pats I'm a US expat currently living full-time in Mexico. I have no current u.s. residence although I do have a mailing address in Nevada. I also do not have us health insurance since I don't live there anymore. I'm hoping to return to the US to get the vaccine as soon as my age group just under 55 is up for the vaccine. Anybody have an idea of how that would work? I keep hearing that it's going to be free because the US use taxpayer dollars to purchase doses but I'm having a hard time getting information on how to actually get signed up and get it administered. It would also be much better for me to travel to a California City since I can limit my flight time and exposure.

And after that how long will it take for THIS subreddit to be permanently censored andor banned outright?There are already multiple COVID subreddits that immediately ban anyone voicing any sort of dissent or disagreement including simply explaining the horrible painful autoimmune responses they received from **getting the vaccine themselves.** This subreddit is a perfect example - there are already countless users ready to block and ban all negative testimonials outright.Even those who are pro-vaxx are getting the second dose and severely suffering with tremors migraines and horrid body pain.

gmpj6w7,The amount of misinformation you’re spreading is disgusting. According to the source you shared there have been 501 deaths from the vaccine so far. Unless you live in an area where they’re handing out fake vaccines it’s unlikely you have been seeing that many adverse reactions. No one is pressuring anyone to take the vaccine. In fact people are being advised not to take it if they have certain underlying health issues or are pregnant. If a nurse is administering a vaccine to a pregnant person that’s on the nurse because pregnant people should not be getting vaccinated to begin with. You should have your nursing certification taken away. I believe in science not QAnon- sorry!,ladymemedaddy,2021-02-09 16:01:02+00:00,,0.6883116883116883,-0.0613046044864226,Negative,gmpi48f,lfky5h

PPE and distancing greatly reduces the risk of catching COVID but it's not 100% effective so if you've been at work around people you could still catch it.    &gt; I understand this is apparently not possible with PCR testing.

ktfpyf,Moderna Vaccine-Admin 17 6pm EST I’ve been quite 5050 about the vaccine for some time now. With my facility pressuring us to all get vaccinated I figured the long term residual effects from contracting the virus far outweighed the shot. I signed in showed all of the proper qualifications and was asked to sit with the nurse. She went over the known side effects and advised me to not try to get pregnant for atleast 6 months. She also stated they would be keeping me for 15mins to ensure I didn’t have an anaphylactic reaction. I received my first dose on 17 at 6pm. The shot itself felt nothing more than a mosquito bite there was a sting during the removal but nothing out of the ordinary.After about 5 mins I had a slight tingle in my arm and mild dizziness that lasted a few seconds.My observation was up and I went on my way.I imagined from my coworkers feedback I would need to take a melatonin to get through the night. (Many said they couldn’t sleep through the night comfortably due to soreness for 3 days.)I had no problem. All day it’s felt nothing more than a post workout at the gym. I did experience some diarrhea today though but all in all I feel completely normal.What I will say is.. I received the information packet after I received the shot. My state’s registration page said it would be emailed to me.. it wasn’t. The packet stated it is not FDA approved (already knew that) AND the trial was only done on 15k people. Which I found pretty alarming. There won’t be any definitive results from the trial published for some time. I do feel I would’ve made a different decision had I known the amount of people involved in the trial. 15k is too small in my opinion. A part of me feels like I volunteered for a free clinical trial for the vaccine.. but there is no turning back now. I am grateful to have worked so closely with patients and not gotten the virus thus far and hope the vaccine is effective and approved eventually. Millions of doses have been dispensed so far so we will soon find out. Stay safe everyone! 🙏,buddhabitch11,2021-01-09 00:23:47+00:00,3.0,0.5447916666666667,0.1583333333333333,Positive,1,ktfpyf

You should not be required to have an antibody test before you are vaccinated.However anyone currently infected with COVID-19 should wait to get vaccinated until after their illness has resolved and after they have met the criteria to discontinue isolation.Additionally current evidence suggests that reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19 is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection. Therefore people with a recent infection may delay vaccination until the end of that 90-day period if desired.Sauce: ,kissingbanditswife,2021-01-13 01:12:50+00:00,,0.41,0.16,Positive,kw5bwv,kw5bwv
m4qgw4,1st Pfizer shot- bad reaction I am having a really bad reaction to my first shot and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I am a 27 year old female. I have mental health issues like an anxiety disorder. The second I got the shot I felt weird and now 12 hours later I woke up actually physically sick as well. My heart has been racing since I got it and my throat feels tight and my anxiety has been through the roof. At first it was just that but now my stomach is upset and I feel like I have the flu.

kwy2up,Pfizer  1 1st dose of Pfizer today!Hi guys! I am a RN working with Covid patients. I’m curious to see how many people have gotten vaccinated after having covid. I had Covid in December (mild case) and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine this morning around 10:15 am. Symptoms so far include very sore arm and felt tired throughout the day. Also very emotional??? Not sure if that has something to do with it. I’ve read that people who get first vaccine after having Covid develop strong symptoms but so far mine have been ok. I’m worried that it’ll get worse 😣 I’d love to hear some experiences!

gpmqvfd,There are so many real-time tips on NYCcoronavirus. If you're willing to travel you have a very good chance of getting an appointment at one of the New York City health and hospitals sites. They used to release appointments at midnight. The two state run sites in the city Javits and aqueduct release appointments throughout the day and are only giving the J&amp;J vaccine in the evening. Otherwise they're giving Pfizer so you could make an appointment at one of those and if it's in a few weeks be pretty sure that they won't have J&amp;J. you could also go to a New York City site (not necessarily New York City health and hospitals) in the morning and put yourself on the waiting list for leftovers and if you're there early enough you might get one. A friend of mine who did that said they always have about five. If you plan to wait for the city to change their policy about drugstores because looking online for a vaccine is too horrible which it can be you may be in for a long wait.,EvanMcD3,2021-03-04 07:47:26+00:00,,0.613037518037518,0.1046103896103896,Positive,lwjrvv,lwjrvv

n2eh78,"A positive experience and some advice I had my second dose of pfizer a few days ago. The only side effects I've had for both doses were mild nausea and appetite loss. I was even doing some heavy lifting afterwards without issue. Some advice that has helped me a lot: -my nurse for the first shot said to  c o m p l e t e l y   relax my arm so I did and maybe that's why I didn't have much soreness. (Did the same for the second dose but my nurse didn't prompt me to that time)-stay off subs like this. The number of people posting negative experiences will far far far outweigh those who had an uneventful one.-Listen to doctors. it takes about eight years to get a medical degree. If you didn't complete eight years of formal study but still think you somehow know better than tens of thousands of doctors from around the globe maybe it's time to google ""how to find reliable information sources"".

m555sv,Second dose Pfizer I'm 25F and have a couple chronic illnesses (Dystonia Stiff Person Syndrome Dysautonomia and Rheumatoid Arthritis) I got the second dose at 11:40 a.m. yesterday.When I got my first dose I had coffee right before and I was pretty anxious to get it done. My heart rate jumped up after I got it and over all I just felt crappy. After learning my lesson I didn't have any coffee before my second dose and this time I felt perfectly normal! I was able to leave right after the 15 minute wait.I've had a rough week health wise so I already had some mild joint pain muscle aches fatigue and headache before getting my second dose. When I got home at 2 p.m. I slept for about five hours. When I woke up in the the evening the joint pain muscle aches and fatigue felt a lot worse. Had a bad case of chills but no fever. Fell back asleep at midnight and slept till 10 a.m. this morning. My symptoms are now back to being mild and very tolerable.I ran low grade after my first shot (99.9F) so when I only got chills yet a normal temp this time I was a little shocked. Still gonna monitor today but so far so good. Over all I feel pretty normal. I should add that I didn't take any OTC medicine after either shot (mostly cause I'm stubborn) so had I taken Tylenol it would have been a breeze. Hope you all are healthy and have an easy time getting the vaccine. I'm so thankful to have gotten mine and would do it again in a heart beat!!Edit: also my arm was SUPER sore both times. No redness or itching though. I get IVIG infusions every four weeks and my last infusion was two weeks ago.  I'm curious what my antibody level will be since I'm on an immunomodulator medicine.

SARS-CoV2 does so damn much damage through out the body that we'll be spending years figuring out what long term damage complications and such that it causes.  Many of those people who ""needed to party"" could end up with increased cancer risk and such later on.

gn2nsm4,"Thank  you for being the guinea pig to test a vaccine for us that has had zero  studies about long-term effects zero studies about its effects on  fertility and pregnancies zero studies about if it even provides any  protection for longer than two months and that did bypass those usually  required studies with emergency admissions.To answer your question here are the immediate effects that you can expect:Pfizer: [Moderna: [In  the Pfizer document the immediate adverse events are in the table  starting at page 35. With ""Severe"" meaning that you aren't able to do  daily activities (aka go to work) when marked with (a) and requires at  least intravenous hydration when marked with (b).So  with the first dose you will have about a 2 to 3% chance of having  severe reaction and a 27% chance that you experience pain that requires  you to take pain medication. The second dose is much more brutal with 5  to 10% for sever reactions and 45% requiring pain medication.It  has a 10 to 20 times higher rate of adverse events than established  vaccinations that did go through the required studies like the Tetanus  or Hepatitis vaccine.

gssi33o,"I would 100% agree with you if the response wasn't so fast.  That's not a response that could possibly be the immune reacting to ""covid"" because you aren't vaccinated with covid and the structures that the vaccine prompts your body to create that mimic covid for purposes of training your immune system take days to start being created.  So a near instantaneous response can't be to those either.  My point was that if it's a response to being vaccinated it's a response to something in the vaccine (some product that helps stabilize or preserve it) and if there's been no previous reaction to vaccines it would be a reaction to something unique in this vaccine.Covid does indeed target the retina but it can't BE covid that caused this reaction.  There's no covid in the vaccine and there's nothing produced by the body that mimics covid as a result of the vaccine for several days.   My intention was not to push back on the idea that the vaccine may have caused this side effect.  Something in the vaccine media certainly may have.  It was to clarify that it wasn't ""COVID targeting the retina"". I hope the side effect is reported in case the incidence level is substantial enough to warrant investigation and as you said promote progression.",Reneeisme,2021-03-30 12:01:25+00:00,,0.4708994708994709,0.108068783068783,Positive,gsqphwf,mfhlov

I have asthma but am otherwise not in one of the high riskcurrent eligibility groups. I completed the questionnaire assuming I would not qualify but did and was able to successfully book an appointment. I've spent the past three days trying to understand what qualified me and if in fact having asthma in my current location (Brooklyn) was enough. I've emailed called and can't seem to get access to review the criteria that would have qualified me to schedule the appointment to confirm that it was valid.According to listed on [ - I am not currently in a priority group that is eligible to receive a vaccine.I feel ethically like I should give up my appointment in the hopes that someone in greater need will get it yet somehow I've had three medical professionals advise that I keep the appointment. Their reasoning: asthma and respiratory conditions are not to be taken lightly vaccines continue to be thrown out daily  not enough people are showing up to vaccination clinics to dispense all of the vaccines that have been thawed  which have to be disposed of after four hours because the temperature is so unstable and that the more people who get vaccinated slows the spread and lowers the statistical risk.Regardless I still feel an ethical responsibility to give up my appointment in the hopes that someone in greater need will be able to take it knowing that there is still the possibility that it could go to waste. There are people who don't have the proper access to technology or know-how who can't book an appointment online and are being told they will have to wait weeks or months for another appointment to become available.Has anyone else had a similar experience?

It got setup by the government and healthcare providers are required to use it.I don't see a single anti-vaxxer post here theorizing about microchip implants. This is a strawman of yours.Just because someone shares informations about a vaccine that did not go through the required clinical testing stages and instead bypassed it with emergency admissions  doesn't mean that he is an anti-vaxxer.I agree to the tested and known to work vaccines like the Tetanus vaccine. I do not agree with an experimental untested vaccine that works on a totally different basis and went through ZERO long term studies and that already shows a 10 to 20 times higher rate of adverse events than any established vaccine.I do think that people who want to get this experimental vaccine should KNOW what they are up to. It is their right to KNOW that they inject something into their body that is untested (for long-term effects). They can not make an informed decision if they do not know.Thinking that people have no right to read the conducted studies about a vaccine is absolutely evil.,lilly-mc,2021-02-11 16:21:32+00:00,,0.5702922077922078,-0.1219155844155844,Negative,gmy96tr,lhcboj

ghrjhx8,"I'm going to add a massive asterisk that I've never heard of any existing vaccine causing some unknown side effects years after administration. Antibody production takes weeks to months and if an autoimmune reaction occurred odds are it would have during the period in which the respective studies were conducted. The trials that yielded the polio vaccine had a much smaller population and a similar follow-up period. This didn't prevent widespread distribution of the vaccine and we're much better for it. Skepticism in science is helpful but it needs a good foundation and this ""we don't know if some bizarre unheard of reaction will occur next year"" is **NOT** it. It's also a bad risk assessment considering we know equally little about the long term effects of a COVID infection even a slightly symptomatic or fully asymptomatic one.

This is just a shot in the dark since I have no idea but it could be that your immune system is dealing with the shots maybe your anxiety is extra in tune with your body after receiving the shot and it seems more likely it’s an ssri symptom just possibly more prevalent after the shot. I’d give your body the time it takes (isn’t it like a month of brain zaps?) while tapering down or getting off them? After that I’d start worrying more..

I thought I would be okay since I didn’t feel any side effects right after receiving the shot. But nope I’m wrong.4 hours after receiving the shot the left arm (where I got the injection) started feeling quite sharp pain. Last night a combination of mild headache + feeling nauseous + pain on left arm had kept me up through my sleep. At some point it’s quite uncomfortable and I just kept waking up during my sleep. After that I tried going back to sleep.Anw now that almost 24 hours have passed since when I got the injection I think I’m feeling much better &amp; quite okay now. No more headache no more feeling nauseous. All that’s left right now is just mild pain on left arm at the moment.I have some questions for those who have gotten both doses of Moderna:• How did you guys feel after receiving 2nd dose? • Any significantserious side effects? • Did you have to take any pain-relief medicine to ease those side effects? If yes can you please let me know which medicine you took? so that I can prepare for myself before I take 2nd dose.Thank you so much everyone.,darxxi,2021-03-14 15:37:18+00:00,4.0,0.3216553287981859,0.0863378684807256,Positive,1,m4xbbq

My daughter and a few friends work in hospitals and say they have vaccine available but they aren’t getting any more people in yet our state won’t move forward to the next group. The consensus is that they are hoping more of the people in the approved age groups will change their minds and come get vaccinated.  So they are holding out for them which is making the rest of us have to wait. My physician at the VA said basically the same thing that they have finished all their employees and the approved age groups and have vaccine available but haven’t been able to move to the next group because the state hasn’t opened up lower age groups yet. So while I’ll admit that might not be the case everywhere I certainly believe it is happening in many places.,darrevan,2021-02-16 21:54:41+00:00,,0.3383116883116883,0.2558441558441559,Positive,gnp0hrx,lle87y

gn272bd,As others have said you shouldn't take the CDC's statement to mean that people who get the vaccine will necessarily be infectious should they be exposed to the virus there just isn't enough data to say whether the vaccine provides sterilizing immunity.I did see a study recently that supports the idea that vaccinated people who are infectious following exposure are much less infectious than they would have been without the vaccine.  Also let's say the vaccine does provide protection from symptoms but not from infectioninfectiousness: theoretically at a certain point enough people will become infected that the spread of the virus will slow or stop [i.e. we will attain herd immunity] but if a large proportion of the population is vaccinated we will get there with many fewer people experiencing severe disease.,peachplumpear85,2021-02-12 14:26:22+00:00,,0.4549242424242425,0.013582251082251,Positive,lhfskb,lhfskb

That you don't understand the science behind it doesn't mean it's bad science. Health professionals who don't make a cent of money from any pharmaceutical company (including myself!) are telling you the science is sound. 3. Opioid crisis is tragic it was Perdue's fault and it relied on no bad science (everyone knew and knows what opioids do!) but on pharmaceutical representatives incentivizing prescriptions and with a lack of data downplaying the addictiveness of the drugs. There is no such lack of data here. Rather there is an abundance thereof.4. Your choice to vaccinate or not vaccinate doesn't just affect you.

They're suspending the use of this vaccine because of a three in ten million risk of a blood clot so that people can instead contract a disease is fatal in at least one in four hundred cases. Every day they waste with suspending these vaccinations is another person potentially dying or getting very ill with covid. And that's before you consider the hesitancy and undermining of confidence that these statements will bring about. Even if the risk of blood clots were genuine it'd still be less of a risk to have the vaccine than run your chances with getting your immunity the old fashioned way.,Snoo-68727,2021-03-16 10:02:15+00:00,,0.462962962962963,-0.1018518518518518,Negative,m5mc4p,m5mc4p

gqeof19,"I can give you a short answer: ""science stuff"".Without an intimate understanding of the subject matter articles like this are only going to arouse fear concern and undue suspicion.  Yes there are always risks to any type of vaccine.  But in classical cases the benefits outweigh the risks by some factor well above 100x.  An equivalent benefit-to-risk inequity is _clear_ with mRNA covid vaccines as well.In short either _TRUST_ the conclusions of those experts or _LEARN_ the subject matter intimately enough to make your own conclusions.  That amount of learning can take a very long time and a lot effort but it is possible.But if you don't want to do either then just stay paralyzed with fear of a phantom that you have invented in your own head while the real danger (the covid virus) has a REAL (1 in 50) chance of killing you leaving you with permanent life-limiting conditions andor become a temporary carrier who transmits it to a vulnerable person who is killed by it.PS: There are some conditions that contraindicate a covid vaccine.  Talk to your doctor about any chronic conditions you may have.  These cases are rare but based on the _science_ analyzing potential risks on both sides -- also it's why everybody else _SHOULD_ get the vaccine: to protect those who cannot take it.",purplepiggies,2021-03-10 03:19:56+00:00,,0.4931578947368421,0.0579824561403508,Positive,m1flt5,m1flt5

gt1tr7b,I know everyone wants to get back to normal as soon as possible but how about sticking to the rhetoric that whatever we put into our bodies or not is a personal decision. It’s terrifying to tell someone that you don’t want the vaccine because they get really aggressive 😅I will not be getting the vaccine because there hasn’t been enough research for long term effects. But as I’m still learning and watching that could change. I’ve also never gotten flu shots and have not had the flu just colds once or twice a year. I just wanted to point out that the numbers that all these official channels are putting up are not accurate. My doctor who is also personal friend has disclosed that in the height of the pandemic they were told by management to enter EVERY death cause as COVID. No matter if the person was shot or heart attack or whatever the real cause was - death notes were entered as COVID. So the Covid death numbers are highly inflated and inaccurate. The reason they do this is because of insurance - insurance pays higher if it’s a Covid death. Knowing this - I will not trust the numbers they put out now in terms of how many deaths are due to Covid vaccine. They could do the complete opposite in this case and make death cause as anything else but by vaccine. Also do to insurance. There is a whole other political capitalism agenda that we cannot see on the surface. Be careful of believing anyone. That said I can see that the vaccine is helping but I’m just cautious of the long term. That said I still think masks should be worn. I actually don’t mind them I bought some really cute ones 😊,leeluuu,2021-04-01 17:07:36+00:00,,0.4429333333333333,0.0324,Positive,mhf98n,mhf98n

But this is so weird it really makes me uneasy and feeling regretful having gotten it so soon. Almost immediately I felt super weak in my muscles almost numb. I got dizzy and drowsy and this lasted mostly of the day but was gone by the morning. For 2 days I felt find but today I felt tired and weak again but not as strongly. But the worst and weirdest part is this terrible taste in my mouth.I thought the flaxseeds I had in my oatmeal had spoiled or something. But the taste in my mouth only grew throughout the day. Finally tonight I googled “bad taste in mouth” thinking I would need to go see a dentist or something but the first result was this being a newly discovered ptizer vaccine side effect. That is just too weird. What the hell? This makes me so uneasy to think about what other side effects they don’t know of yet.

gsxu0x7,No shit. I’ve done my research. Actually the j&amp;j was reported to have MORE harmful side effects among young people (I have asthma as well). Thank you for your kind comment.
