gg5ic5k,Thank you for sharing I have too many looming questions: -is this vaccine 100% affective ?-can mRNA alter our genetic make up (DNA)-short term &amp; long term effects ?-ethics ?-which Countries do not compensate individuals who are harmedinjured by vaccines?-other then the 2nd dose at 21 days will you need more boosters in the future?I urge people to stop and think for themselves. Make an informed decision before getting shot up.,Positive

gr88eqj,I also have very bad anxiety and panic attacks. I am young between 20-30. I have a pituitary tumor. Terrible allergies (peanuts wheat oral allergies medication allergies). I also have severe asthma.I am on day three and I haven’t had any symptoms aside from swollen lymph nodes under my armpit for a few hours. That is simply a sign that my immune system is fighting an infection or illness. I get swollen lymph nodes when I’m sick.The best thing to do is read reliable sources from the CDC about reactions  symptoms and how they are handled.You can read about people’s experiences but I recommend going to the group that was linked by another person on your post.

I'm on around day 7 of  this nose dryness but it's starting to get quite a bit better. It's either a vaccine side effect OR I coincidentally got some allergy or something around the time I got the shot but it's definitely not covid. Weird thing is though my nose has NEVER been dry like this. Ever. So I'm still suspicious that it's a vaccine side effect.How did your test come out? I hope you didn't get the 'rona.

m1w9ek,2nd Moderna appt canceled last minute My MIL was scheduled for her 2nd dose of moderna to be given 311 but her clinic just canceled it without any further plan for her. I’m scrambling to get her the second dose before the 42 day max interval (per cdc). It’s tough enough to get a vaccine at all let alone get one specific brand. I was able to book a Pfizer Vax for her on 312 but I’d very much prefer to get her the same one she’s already had. The cdc website does say “In exceptional situations if the vaccine product given as the first dose cannot be determined or is no longer available any mRNA COVID-19 vaccine product may be administered at least 28 days after the first dose.” I figured I’d rather have different types in the correct interval than the same type in the wrong interval. I also don’t want to pass up the opportunity to get her this one on 313 and run the risk of not finding a better option. Has anyone had a similar situation? Thoughts  advice?,Neutral

gg6dgke,I work in clinical trials and can shed some light on common protocol deviations.  Anytime the protocol isn’t followed it’s reportable to the study sponsor (Pfizer) and the local review board.  Most are considered low risk and do not alter the course of data analysis. For example on a symptom questionnaire the patient forgot to initial or maybe wrote in the wrong date on accident.   This would be a deviation.  Or.  The visit window wasn’t followed. For example 2nd injection is required at day 30+ or - 7 days and the patient comes in on day 38 (one day out of window). Very few are serious— for example If a patient was given the wrong injection or the wrong dose.  It would be nice to see what these deviations were but I can share after 15 years of clinical trials expertise that the vast majority do not alter any analysis course.  Hope this helps.,Neutral

Side effects the next day were arm pain (similar to tetanus shot- more sore than an average shot but nothing out of the ordinary or concerning) and some numbness in my right hand. Right forearm was unaffected. Soreness dissipated as the day went on  Second shot 02102021. Woke up around 2am with chills and headache woke up at 630 am with severe headache and fever of 103. Tylenol helped but needed about 3 rounds (1000mground) before fever broke about 12 hours later. All in all pretty normal experience- happy to be fully vaccinated. Even though the second shot kicked my ass I felt better after running a fever because I felt like my body was doing it’s job.,Positive

gqrwo7j,It will almost certainly become an endemic virus but that doesn’t mean the pandemic will never end. Booster shots may be necessary but once you’re vaccinated you will have an immune response to the virus that you didn’t have before. You have a defense. Immunity might wane to a degree over time and symptomatic infection may be more possible  but you’ll also much much much more likely to have mild symptoms even if you do get infected based on our experiences with other vaccines.,Positive

gmu1fjj,&gt; get CoVid vaccine  &gt;it is worse than getting CoVidYou did this to yourself. This whole sub is a constant flood of people reporting how bad the vaccine is. Meanwhile my whole neighborhood had CoVid and not a single person experienced any symptoms as severe as people who post here got after the vaccine.This vaccine is experimental. There is not a single study about long-term effects. Not a single study about special interest people (like pregnant women). And the one two month study that Pifzer and Moderna did resulted in 45% of people requiring painkillers after the second dose. And they don't even guarantee that you have any positive effects for longer than two months!

ghpe5rt,TLDR: Yes it will be less effective  Most people however will still receive some immunity but for how long is unknown and It is not as effective as a 2 dose strategy.In Britain the MHRA* has approved a change in the guidance for rolling out the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines to extend the period before you receive the second dose from 3 weeks to 12 weeks. This has been done because the balance of evidence that indicates that it is more effective at population level to rollout a single dose quickly to far more people than it is to provide both doses within a short period of time to a smaller number... In the situation where supplies are currently limited.*Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency - basically the British FDA EMAThis approach is being applied to both vaccines approved in the UK despite the very different nature of them and it is far to say has not been met without debate by elements of the medical community .... Although the majority of comments have been on technicalities of the rollout or the nature of this being an unproven approach rather than arguing against the principal.For the AstraZeneca vaccine it is thought a later second dose strategy may actually improve the efficacy of the vaccine... For the Pfizer vaccine this is not though to be the case.There is no debate however that the second dose is required nor is a one dose strategy proposed in the UK or elsewhere (that I am aware of).The efficacy evidence from the Phase 3 trials of all the leading vaccines have been based on 2 dose strategies and the evidence to consider a one dose strategu is based on limited data and theoretical understanding of how vaccines work.. Consequently it is known that one dose will have lower overall efficacy... Although over a short period of time this may not be significant for the Pfizer vaccine in particular.There are very few medical professionals however proposing a single dose strategy because all the evidence and knowledge regarding how vaccines work is that you require the second 'booster' vaccine to maximise the effectiveness of the first.. including for ensuring that your longer term immune memory is fully engaged. The more limited debate is simply on the limited grounds of what the best strategy is for rollout.,Positive

Problem is they don’t either of them seem to be in the hurry they need to be. Sorry to be so cynical but the way this rollout is going it will never work. By the time all of us “willing and eager” to get the vaccine receive it the “immunity” from those who got vaccinated initially will likely be ineffective. Unless something changes rather quick I can see this being a years long battle to deal with with who knows how many millions dead.,Neutral

mhg30g,Anti-inflammatory dietTurmeric effect on Covid Vaccine effectiveness I haven’t found any studies about natural immunosuppressant supplement effects online so was hoping maybe someone on here who was vaccinated happens to use a lot of turmeric and has gotten the spike antibody test. I didn’t realize that studies have shown turmeric to both lessen certain viruses from fulling infecting the body and inhibit antibody production until after I got vaccinated. I drink multiple cups of turmeric tea every day and use the turmeric spice a lot. Like way more than a normal person. The day I got the vaccine I also took turmeric curcumin supplements to prevent inflammationside effects (not thinking that I shouldn’t try to prevent inflammation!). I had zero side effects from the first vaccine. My arm wasn’t even the slightest bit sore when I woke up the next morning.,Positive

Even if there is a small risk it is a million times better than the alternative of being unprotected to covid. But I do still worry about some crazy reaction like sudden death anyway.,Neutral
gln2fec,As a policy stance I do not think anyone will recommend that you spend time unmasked with people yet. We are still early on in our vaccine distribution and if the scientists and folks start talking about gathering too early it could on a society scale lead to problems.     You might have to consider the risks for yourself. Maybe meet up indoors with masks on or plan an outdoor picnic if you're somewhere warm. Go through the risks with the other person and really think about them. Is there anyone unvaccinated at home you're still trying to keep safe? Could it affect either of your jobs if you get COVID (but don't have a severe case)? How are hospitals doing in your area?    I know it's a struggle to wait especially once you're vaccinated. But we are still trying to consider this on a societal level so that varients are reduced and we can all go back to normal.,Positive

They've continued for four days. I've read this is a possible delayed-onset minor anaphylaxis reaction regardless of whether you take Pfizer Moderna Astra Zeneca or Johnson and Johnson. It's rare but happens.If your body mounts this kind of allergic response to the vaccine will this keep you from building the proper immune response to COVID-19 spike proteins?I also had the typical first-night soreness at the injection site along with mild gastro effects on day two.

gr5mvmh,I have not seen any credible sources saying that people have died from the vaccines and I'm guessing your parents can not source any credible evidence to back their claims.  The immune system uses a lot of energy to work its magic and its not surprising that you may still feel kinda lousy.  Try to relax and let your body rest you'll be fine.,Positive
gj5930i,Do you not realise that literally every medication will cause severe side effects for a small number of people? It's just something that happens.

mi6rb9,Getting Moderna dose  2 on Monday had an adverse reaction to dose  1. I'm due to get my second dose this upcoming week. I've honestly considered just skipping it after my experience with the first dose but I know I have to persevere through.For dose  1 I was a mix of nervous and excited to get it. I am not afraid of needles and did fine with the administration but within minutes of sitting down in the observation area my heart rate spiked a tinglywarmsweaty feeling broke out over my entire body and my vision started blacking out. Unfortunately there was nowhere to lie down in the waiting area at CVS but I did lower my head between my legs and managed to get up to ask the nurse for some water. I never lost consciousness but definitely felt like it was a close call. I felt better within 10-15 minutes of drinking some water.I've had vasovagal responses several times in the past (blood draws TB test other medical stress) but never to a vaccine so I was surprised! I'm assuming this was a vasovagal response but don't 100% know for sure.The problem is for the past 4 weeks I have been having intense anxiety about this reaction occurring again for dose  2. I'm now about 100x more nervous for this appointment than the first: not for the shot itself but I just don't want to pass out. The pre-syncope symptoms are so distressing and uncomfortable for me and I'm afraid to go through it again.I think I would be fine if I could lay down during the shot and for the observation period but I'm not sure if that's even possible at CVS. I've also toyed around with the idea of asking the nurse if I can wait out the observation in my car so I can lay down and recline the seat but don't know if that's allowed either and am worried I would faint on the walk to the car anyways. Ugh. I could use some words of encouragement I guess.,Neutral

gnyo9ov,Hey sorry this happened to you. I got the Pfizer today and about two minutes after my heart rate jumped and I got some dizziness. Decided to stay for 40 minutes instead of the typical 15 minutes they ask you to stay after getting the vaccine and I just hung out an extra 20 minutes in my car while still at the hospital just to make sure I was completely good. I'm thinking the vaccine had a little to do with my high heart rate but I also think my anxiety had a lot to do with it. Make sure to just keep hydrated and maybe get a blood pressure cuff for home to have some peace of mind. My resting rate is still around the 90-100 range but nothing too crazy. Of course its ultimately your choice but I'll definitely still be getting the second dose. Now I just know what to possibly look out for so it gives a certain peace of mind. Hope you feel better!,Neutral

gk7zw7b,You should talk to your healthcare provider about your reaction to Gardasil and your concerns. The covid vaccine is not recommended to people who have had certain types of severe reactions to vaccines in the past. If it wasn't severe it will give your practitioner the opportunity to chat with you about possible side effects and some preventative measures you might take. I had a reaction to the moderna vaccine and my MD recommended 50mg of Benadryl 2hrs prior to the second dose for instance.,Neutral

By 5pm I felt normal with just a tiny hint of a headache.I went to bed at 1030pm feeling fineI awoke at 1145pm feeling the chills and had a fever in the 101* range - maxing at 101.8* on my ear thermometer when checked through the night. I tried to go back to sleep to no avail - I just couldn't sleep and my wife was worried so she kept taking my temperature every 30 mins or so. About 4am I took a shower and 2 Advil.By 6am my temperature was down to 100.4* and I was finally able to get some sleep. I slept until about 1030am and when I awoke my temp was normal - 98.6*Sunday I just felt worn out but I accredited that to the lack of sleep and the fever kicking my butt during the night. By Monday I felt fine - still a little tired but overall fineIn hindsight I probably should've taken the Advil earlier than I did but i was exhausted (up since 630am Sat morning) and just wanted to sleep. Since then I've had no issues.

gql9ayc,Listen Cesario. You are very wrong. The mainstream media has purposely obfuscated any real information about the vaccines. Please consider these three official studies:You have also been fooled into thinking that just because you had a relative that suffered from Covid (debatable if it was actually Covid since it has never been isolated and because the PCR tests give 50%-70% false positives) that the vaccine can't be dangerous. The two things are not mutually exclusive.Have you seen the VAERS data?  If you haven't you can't say anything. Many people have died within 24 hours of taking the vaccine: You don't lose anything by being a bit open minded on this point. I'm sorry about the close call of your family member. That doesn't change that what I'm saying is true. Please lower your defenses and consider that big pharma vaccine companies government and media who have been lying to us all for all of your lives are perpetrating something horrible here.,Negative

mh8lcw,Help. I feel guilty. Should I cancel my appointment So my eligibility for the covid vaccine opens up tomorrow. I am expecting that it will be nearly impossible to get an appointment because suddenly millions of people will be eligible in my area. I am the sole caretaker for my 98 year old grandmother. She is vaccinated but we are both still nervous about me bringing it back to her after going out for her essentials. I do not live with her but go there a few times a week to bring her her food cook meals clean change lighbulbs that kind of stuff. She and her dr have been very concerned about me not being vaccinated and around her. I do not leave my house other than for essentials and to go to her. I have not seen any other person in the last year. Its a very lonely and depressing time for me. Anyways she and another relative encouraged me to sign up for the vaccine ahead of my eligibility but make the appointment after my age group opens up. So I made an appointment earlier in the week for next week. To do so I had to lie about my eligibility. Now I am feeling really guilty and remorseful. I guess I am asking for opinions on this. Am I a terrible person? I am leaning towards canceling it and just re-trying after midnight tonight. I feel horrible but I know my grandmother will be disappointed if I am unable to get a vaccine soon!,Negative

gr6trrn,I think the “less than 100% “ part is important to say. The risk of anaphylaxis although rare has already been established. It’s too early to say which if any of the VAERS reports indicate a connection with the vaccine.When people hear “it’s safe“ but then hear of people going into anaphylactic shock or reports of deaths and Bells palsy it’s easy to feel like they were lied to when they were told that the vaccine is safe. Even the manufactures don’t say it’s safe. We cannot know what ill effects may occur further down the road. The vaccines have not received full FDA approval.  They are still being monitored. The vaccine manufacturers are sufficiently concerned about injuries that they insisted on protection from any legal liability for vaccine injuries. I think it would be foolhardy for the public to trust the vaccines more than the companies themselves do.None of what I say is meant to say don’t get the vaccine. COVID is pretty bad for a lot of people and you have to weigh the risks. I just think it’s incredibly important that people be given the whole truth about the vaccines. If we try to sugarcoat it people can’t give informed consent.,Positive

gr2idzh,thats just what the nurse told me when i got my vaccine on saturday (in ny),Neutral
gmn7xda,I have anxiety issues that I take meds for and was a little scared about the vaccine but knew that I wasn't going to let that stop me. I got the second dose last month and I am so so glad I did! The little bit of worry about side effects from the vaccine was nothing in comparison to  a year spent worrying about contracting a virus that could kill me (I had my anxiety med dose increased because my anxiety over the virus was so high). Side effects from the second dose weren't necessarily fun but they were tolerable. I didn't have any symptoms such as tachycardia. Just run of the mill flu like symptoms that started  around 24 hours after the shot and lasted 24hr.  I oveeall just felt kind of blah and I only had those side effects after the second dose. I would absolutely do it again if I had to.(I also take meds for migraines but didn't need any after the vaccine),Positive
gqhznn5,I'm not an anti-vax person but I think it's perfectly reasonable to be skeptical over the rapid safety testing. I don't really trust the media to tell me if 4-5 days of symptoms is normal since like you say that would definitely dissuade people from getting the vaccine. Without that trust I'm not sure what to believe. There peer-reviewed studies haven't been published yet.I did notice pounding heart palpitations last night but wasn't brave enough to go to the hospital. I'm way sicker and have been sicker for much longer than I expected when getting the first shot. I'm also hoping this doesn't go on much longer. Good luck and stay healthy!,Positive
gkzv0lf,Kinda like everyone else.  Sore arm for a day.  When I got home I was tired and took a nap for a couple hours.  Nothing serious.  50y,Negative

m2ir1c,Can I get the covid vaccine if I work at Target? The covid vaccine is now available to Food workers. I work at Target which has a foodgrocery department BUT I work in clothing. I sometimes handle food when backing up cashier but for the most part I work in clothing. Would I be able to get the vaccine on the technicality that Target sells food and I sometimes back up cashier?,Positive
gsku1to,Nope.  Everyone I know with issues it took several hours for them to feel anything.  You might have some moderate arm pain if you lift heavy things at work- that is the only effect I know that comes on really quickly.,Neutral
gszxb7n,Sorry that's really scary. I was talking to my nurse friend. She said that she has seen pretty often that when people at that age are pulled from there environment and put in a hospital setting sometimes they don't really recover to where they were mentally. They can become really disoriented even when they were fine before. She brought it up after we saw how sick my wife got from the vaccine and we were feeling kind of scared for the older folks who would likely end up in the hospital if they had a similar reaction.,Neutral

gitei7j,I live in Florida and they are doing an investigation of wealthy people who came to Florida and had a friend who owned a retirement home give them the shot. I would not do it as they have to track the vaccine by lot numbers. You would hate to have all the senior citizens put you on their hate lists.,Negative

ko2dkw,9 days post Pfizer Let me be the first to say I was nervous as hell and surprised I was first in line in my department to get it. I was basically everyone experiment. They give you a card to track the shots you get. My nurse showed me how much they were injecting into you so you can visibly see. It didnt hurt getting injected in. They make you wait for 15minutes to make sure you don’t have a bad reaction. With my anxiety I ended up pacing in the back row to calm down because my mind likes to trick me into thinking something is wrong. Post shot: felt a little shaky but I’m not sure if it was due to my anxiety. Besides that I felt fine. A few hours later my face felt feverish but I had no fever. 2nd day I only had the feverish face sniffles and injection sight pain. I’ve felt fine every since! Second shot is on the 11th. To be honest I didn’t read any information about the shot because I know I’d cause myself a panic attack after getting the shot😂. Still going strong though.,Neutral
meo7s7,Is the 2nd dose of Moderna the same at the first? So my company had a contract with this other company giving the shots but the contract ended and now I'm kinda left to fend for myself for the 2nd shot. It is way harder than I thought to get the second shot. I'm scared if I lie just the possibilities. Like is the formula different in the second shot etc.,Neutral
gsun82f,The inflammatory process linked with antibody production somehow and anti inflammatory meds can reduce antibody production. But I wouldn't worry about it. Take them to make yourself feel better. You'll still have plenty of antibodies. The only scenario I would say to avoid them is with real covid where it would be better to suffer and give the virus hell. But there is no virus here so why suffer.And one side effect of covid is blood clots so aspirin can actually be beneficial for other reasons. I took aspirin with my vaccine due to reports of some blood clotting with astrazeneca,Positive
glqpjsn,I suggest you follow kinggutterbabe on instagram shes actually a scientist and debunks a lot of things in a clear easy way. Its so upsetting to hear u say its  99.98 percent survival rate. Please do the math. We have this rate because people are masking. There are countries not following guidelines and hundreds of people are dying daily and thousands being left crippled. Pandemics exist and have happened before and vaccines are an actual god send. Millions have already taken the vaccine. Theres no such thing as long term side effects. Vaccines side effects take place at least within the same month you get the vaccine. Long covid is no joke i wouldnt wish it on anyone. Its also more common than youd think. You're very lucky if you dont have anyone close to you or crippled by covid. You have masking and science to thank for that. Please leave the conspiracy theories alone. Its people like you who probably dont wear a mask the reason why so many people i know have died.,Neutral

kti12v,Pfizer Day 3 It's me again! It has been roughly 60 hours since my 1st Pfizer covid-19 shot and I am happy to say that I am side effect free. Nothing new came up so I think it is safe to say that I am out of the woods. I will not post any more updates unless any new developments occur with me but I think once I get my second dose I will report any side effects I get from that if any.,Positive
lnxge7,Is eligibility in California based on where you live or work? I was wondering since my county i LIVE in is only doing healthcare workers teachers and 65 and over.

gqza9zn,My mother who is 58 yrsold had her thyroid removed 9 years ago and who is an essential worker received first shot of Pfizer vaccine 5 days ago. No side effects whatsoever. Her right arm where the vaccine was given hurt a little first 3 days. She described me the pain like she done a lot of workout at the gym. Other then that she is a champ and I am sure that she will have no issues with second shot. I would watch out for any misinformation and take it with a grain of salt. Don’t think of it much and don’t get involved in bullshit arguments on the internet. That usually the point and tactics used by Foreign entities on any social platforms including Reddit. As a Ukrainian-American I think that I got immune to any bullshit online 7 years ago when I lived in Ukraine. No ones dicks will fly off to the orbit of Uranus as a side effect. No Illuminati Reptilloids will implant you with a tracking chip. Russians can shove their Sputnik vaccine up to their asses. I bet Putin and Russian upper echelon of government got American made vaccines.Refer to the CDC official page regarding side effects talk to your doctor if you have any allergies and concerns. Some people might experience allergic reactions after the shot. That’s why you have to wait for 15 minutes after the shot was given. I will 100% get a vaccine as soon as it will get publicly available at my State. More people get a vaccine more quickly we can eradicate this disease and return to normal life. Additionally travel abroad will be much easier if you can present an evidence of receiving vaccine and mandatory quarantines can be avoided. Everyone receives a card after getting vaccinated with a date on it and a type of vaccine received. More importantly you will protect not only yourself but people around you. Especially elderly and immune compromised population. We must show respect to one another and do what’s needs to be done in order to protect ourselves and each other. Cheers,Positive
ghkawo5,Just got the moderna today as far as I know I haven’t had covid I received an antibody test in November.  This is day 1 for me felt fine after then my arm started to really hurt.

gpo79ds,You could try urgent care clinics or clinics that are pop ups at hospitals or at medical centers. Does your county have a website that lists out the upcoming vaccine clinics and locations? Have you tried your local nextdoor app? Here in CA that’s where you can find out what’s going on by word of mouth on the nextdoor app. Also some local grocery stores pharmacies are giving out the shot and may have a left over at the end of the day. Putting yourself there in person when they open to ask to be put on a waiting list and then showing up towards when they are giving the last doses. Best of luck be willing to drive a ways away to get on a list and be there in person to sign up in the morning and to get it at the end of their day.,Positive

gheexdb,"You make a lot of good points particularly the one about antibiotic resistance and I agree there were still far too many people who had no sense that a virus was any different than a bacterium before this year.  Maybe the explanation ""its a virus like covid and needs a vaccine (that doesn't yet exist) to prevent it not antibiotics which will do nothing"" might work more often now.  On the other hand I suspect the overlap between the ""it's a hoax"" group and the ""give me antibiotics"" group is substantial.I don't understand how you can have a pretty firm grip on concepts like communicability and antibiotic resistance and say ""I just think the shot is useless"" though.  Even if you had it you are pushing your personal immunity forward in time and the more simultaneous (or near simultaneous) immunity we achieve the more that curve is going to flatten. Herd immunity is apparently too much to hope for given how much resistance there is to taking the vaccine and especially in light of this new more communicable strain.  But any reduction in the amount circulating is far from ""useless"".  What in the world makes you say that?",Positive

m2styd,Study Find Unvaccinated People are 44 Times More Likely to Get COVID-19 Pfizer has announced study results from Israel (where 23 of the population is vaccinated) that its COVID-19 vaccine is 94% effective against asymptomatic – a major indicator that the vaccine prevents transmission of the disease. The vaccine is also 97% effective at preventing severe disease and death. It was also found to be effective against the UK Variant. Not enough South African variant is present in Israel for useful data on the vaccine’s effectiveness against that variant. And if you’re still hesitant about getting vaccinated unvaccinated individuals were 44 times more likely to develop symptomatic COVID-19 and 29 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who had received the vaccine.Israel made an agreement to give Pfizer certain patient data about vaccinations in return for enough vaccines from the company for the entire country (most western countries would not be willing to do that but having been in a near constant state of war since its modern founding Israelis have a different view on civil liberties and the needs of the state). So that’s why we don’t have similar data on the Moderna vaccine. But since the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are both based on mRNA technology the results from Israel give reason to be hopeful for the Moderna vaccine as well.Read more here: [,Positive

ONCE someone is scheduled and they know how many vaccinations that day then they will take out vials. But that means if you see an open appt and you sign up theyre going to thaw a vial. And if it turns out that you dont qualify and they have to send you home its a waste vial. so absolutely anyone should feel guilty about signing up for appts theyre ineligible for. Not only does it not help vaccine waste it can cause it if they stick to their policy which most will. And people getting appointments is a HUGE ISSUE when they dont qualify. If you dont qualify dont sign up guys. Please dont do it. Its not ethical its not helping it is jumping the line. What is ethical?

My sypmtoms may be entirely from the vaccine or any combo of it anxiety and allergies.I recieved my first shot at 10:13 am today (1.9.21) and shortly after I felt an intense rush of heat through my entire body that made me sweat. I also became a little dizzy (could have been anxiety or the fact that I was in a gym with a bunch of people = stuffy) and my nose started to burn. I felt a little bit out of it (like i had a shot of liquor) but nothing serious. I also noticed that my teeth started to hurt which was followed by aches and pains and that lasted for about half an hour and came back later but less intense. I got a mild headache in the back of my head which moved to the front before going away 20 minutes later. No difficulty breathing or any itchinghiving (for the record i am allergic to corn soy almonds peanuts and kiwi).Throughout the day my arm (injection site) hurt alot. Opening cabinets was painful.

gszj9v4,I had Covid in March 2020 and got the first Moderna shot 5 days ago. The day after I felt tired ran a low-grade fever had chills slight nausea and generally felt icky and out of it. Next day I felt much better and went running day after I also felt fine and went running again. I've been tired today but I ran about 10 miles yesterday and have been working long hours so it probably is more those factors than vaccine side effects at this point lol. I'm 36f and had Covid for about 2 weeks with chest burning that lingered a couple months. To be honest I'm on the fence about the second shot. I wish we could get a Covid passport if we could show a certain amount of antibodies in a blood test... Also my parents both had Covid at the end of December and both got Moderna 3.5 weeks ago.

goe53g0,"Fair question.  Vaccine hesitation should not be confused with anti-vaxxers - especially for those at lower risk of serious COVID infection.  The answer is that while the vaccines have undergone a very rigorous review at the end of the day it is impossible to know for certain their long-term side effects.  Both as a human civilization and as individuals it's all a question of risk.  Looking globally if there are long term side effects the majority of the world population will be experiencing them.  But even that won't be worse for the world than the long term side-effects of COVID - death world economic slow down my kids constantly in the house (not necessarily in that order).  Looking at that risk individually - if you were in a nursing home or a health care worker the risk equation might look radically different than from the perspective of a healthy 30 something.  So it's a fair question.  At the end of the day you are still at risk for COVID - both to yourself and those around you.  And it's more than likely that you will have to get used to COVID vaccinations anyway - because at the rate of mutation that is occurring we may be getting COVID boosters shots every year or two.  And to that point even if everyone gets the vaccine and you don't and then you get COVID you could be the source for the next COVID mutation - potentially negating the vaccine everyone else got.  And one final thing to keep in mind.  Israel has half its population vaccinated and is seeing a massive drop in cases.  They are opening up stores and gathering places...to people with ""green cards.""  That is people who can show they've been vaccinated.  In other words the way things are going if you want to enjoy even a small amount of the pre-COVID freedom you once had you may need to prove that you were vaccinated.  So forget about saving the world do it to go see a movie again.",Neutral

It was admitted by many scientists including Dr.Offit who is on FDA  independent committee that approved mRNA vaccines that the lipid nanoparticles could create a problem with the mRNA vaccines. These particles are toxic  and non biodegradable. At least we know that in mice they are able to stay in blood for long time and then cumulate in liver spleen and less in lungs.They also can penetrate into brain. We don't know how these particles behave in the humans. The high reactogenity of mRNA vaccines ( wide spectrum of side effects) could be contributed by the lipid nanoparticles. That's why any new vaccines have to be studied for long time to prove their safety.,Neutral

So I showed up and got the shot around 4 PM. Anyhow similar to some of the other people’s experience the shot felt lighter than a flu shot and the pinch was insignificant in my opinion. I tried to move my arm around right after to get the muscles relaxed a bit. Into the night the soreness started to kick in but it wasn’t bothering me at all but I did have to sleep on the other side. Day after the soreness was slightly worse but still not bothersome. I was able to move my arm around like normal but I had to be extra mindful. Stretching the arm was hard but not impossible. I felt completely normal and went to work as usual. Fast forward to today (so two days after) I haven’t experienced any fatigue or fever other than a sore arm around the shot area. Soreness’s almost gone. Still alive and well. Second dose got scheduled for 430 so we’ll see. PS. I work out in the gym and do a lot of yoga so and have always been active so that could have been the reason why my arm did not feel that bad??!,Neutral

n1f58i,Covid Vaccine and Prion Diseases. Hello everyone I am concerned by the possibility of negative effects regarding the Covid vaccine. I've been studying the relation between this new MRNA Vaccine and a possible relation to Prion diseases such as : Alzheimers Disease and ALS . There's not a whole lot of evidence or literature regarding this concern as the vaccine is new and long term side effects are unclear. But i believe there should be more studies and an open discussion about the possibility of such serious side effects. The information I was able to find was very confrontational. There were a lot of interesting points coming from both sides. But the resounding opinion was that it's more unlikely for such a mutation to occur from the vaccine. But personally I am still interested in delving deeper into the subject and would like to hear your thoughts. These are pretty intense accusations and very serious diseases.There is plenty of literature apposing the idea of this new mNRA vaccine causing these diseases to occur but I recommend seeking out literature solely based on mNRA and and the relation to Prions Diseases and how mNRA's effectchange the protein of your cells.  &amp; x200B;Let's chat.

After reading this article my gut instinct is to not have it but I just want to make sure this isn't an irrational feeling. I have never felt this way about a vaccine before.

Look it up it's on 100% of news articles bending over backwards to disconnect the injury from the injection without any exculpatory evidence.  It may be that they are indeed unrelated but I'm bothered by the *unsupported certainty* of giving the benefit of the doubt to the vaccine instead of following the evidence where it leads.  They've already abandoned many protocols by giving the placebo group the vaccine because it was ""unfair for them not to get it.""

kqieo5,Vaccine Fears I want to preface this by saying that I am not opposed to vaccines in the slightest and trust the medical system.Here is my main worry: the side effects of this vaccine seem to correlate with the effects of COVID. The main side effect that I'm worried about is that if there is an immune response wherever there is an ACE2 protein (I am not a biologist but this is according to what I have read) and if the brain expresses this protein then there may be inflammation in the brain.The main effect set of COVID I fear is the neurological and I fear that if I take this vaccine that it can cause neurological damage on par with what COVID causes. Chronic brain inflammation is also linked to depression anxiety and many other psychological maladies. I did read an article that mentions how neurological effects are correlated with severity of illness but even then COVID still causes neurological damage regardless of severity ([) and the vaccine's severity is relatively low but we know so little about the brain and have such poor insight when it's damaged that it seems like a very high risk from my perspective.I'm afraid of both COVID and this vaccine. Is there any credence to my fears regarding neurological damage caused by the vaccine? I understand no studies have really been done about it but maybe the effect simply hasn't been revealed yet.,Neutral

mfstfg,Cbd oil and covid vaccine Hi - this might be a really dumb question but I take Humira which suppresses my immune system so the covid vaccine may not be as effective for me - not enough data yet.

Does anyone know if it’s ok to take cbd oil while receiving an mRNA vaccine? Wasn’t sure if it could suppress something or interact in some way. Thanks.,Positive
goblfdx,I don't think it would be a good decision at least for the US to buy vaccines from China or Russia. We already have enough doses secured from Moderna and Pfizer and both are boosting their production. If we were to buy vaccines from Russia or China we'd have to wait for them since both countries have other orders to fulfill. We also have more vaccines coming from Novavax and Johnson and Johnson.Overall this video makes some good points but it generalizes things. Although geopolitics may have played a role so far the US hasn't had a need to buy vaccines from Russia or China. Maybe European nations and Canada could benefit but even then it depends on when such orders would be fulfilled (would they receive them before or after Moderna Pfizer etc.),Positive

There were 2 healthcare workers that had a serious reaction because they were allergic -- but apparently nobody bothered to check before they were given the vaccine.People are not wrong to want to wait-and-see and it certainly does not make them anti-vaxers or anti-science or unintelligent least of all murderers.,Neutral

Technically even a negative test does not absolve the possibility of having covid. It could also very simply mean that you were tested too soon after being exposed. Not saying at all that this is your reality. The vaccine essentially prevents YOU from developing severe covid but it doesn’t stop you from possibly giving covid to someone else who could possibly develop severe covid illness,Negative

gmyuyuf,"Ya know I just got the moderna vaccine yesterday morning first dose and i'm still feeling pretty terrible more than 24 hours later. I had covid about 90 days ago so i was assuming i had the antibodies but wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of the vaccine when it was offered to me. Glad to know i'm not the only one feeling these crazy side effects after the first dose so i'm wondering how common this is. It's probably because our immune systems are already comfortable with fighting off the foreign substance but i was hoping to feel better way quicker. i caved and took extra strength tylenol. Really hoping the second dose isn't worse than this though.but as a public health professional i'm not too concerned that we're dying. lol. our bodies just know ""what's up"". i'm looking forward to the paper where they did a study that those who have covid may only need one dose of the vaccine.",Neutral

lj5px8,Experiencing mild muscle spasms I got my first dose Pfizer covid vaccine yesterday at 10am and besides a sore arm around injection site I’ve started getting small muscle spasms throughout my body starting about 5 hours after the vaccine. You know when a random muscle in your body twitches slightly? It’s like that but 5+ times a minute varying from being on my arm shouldersback calves thighs and butt. I have not had them occur this often ever before and they have been continuing since the initial 5 hours after the vaccine. It is not painful at all or extreme visible twitching just quite annoying. I looked up to see if anyone else has experienced this after the vaccine and so far nothing. Was wondering if anyone else has had this side effect?,Neutral

lq33b4,Moderna vaccine I (32F yes this might be relevant) received the second dose of this version of the vaccine two days ago and the expected physical side effects occurred. The first one gave me a migraine which then caused nausea that was bad enough to cause me to vomit. The second one gave me a headache full body aches and pains and mild joint pain. I've only heard about people experiencing physical effects but no mention of emotionalpsychological.I say this because while I can't say that the vaccine is what caused this the timing is rather suspect. Today out of the blue I became extremely angry. There was absolutely no reason for me to do so. I wasn't doing anything to cause me to become angry and I wasn't remembering any past experiences that would have been bad enough to reproduce the anger now that I felt then. Over the course of the next few hours things that are barely mild annoyances suddenly became rage inducing.I've excluded other things that could be the cause. It wasn't PMS as my period ended last week I have no mood disorders and this has never happened before in my recollection.,Neutral

gr2xt5v,The first dose went pretty good as far as joint pain. It was mild and lasted for about two days then I felt perfectly normal. I went into a flare a couple days before my second dose so I've been managing with NSAIDS in the meantime. Something I found out through my rheumatologist is that it's not recommended to take steroids for at least two weeks after the second dose. I'll be restarting Humira next time I see her in about a month. I was grateful since it was in remission for over a year hoping to get back to that soon!,Positive

I'm 22 F and spoke to everyone at work today to see what their thoughts were as we have been asked if we want too be added to the list for the vaccine but everyone my age (all the younger people) are saying they are not getting the vaccine mostly due to long term risks.I'm now 50 50 and have no idea what to do.

gn7rdjv,Hello! 22 yo female and I received the Pfizer vaccine. 1st dose I felt dizzy and fatigued after receiving the vaccine at 2:00 pm and the arm pain at the injection site was awful. Only experienced extreme fatigue and (perhaps unrelated?) diarrhea in the 3 days following. On the day of the 2nd dose my arm was hurting but not as bad as the first time and I felt like I had a good amount of energy. However come nightfall I had the chills and couldn’t get warm. I barely slept that night and woke up the next day feeling like I had the flu: chills body aches fever of 102 nausea vomiting and diarrhea. Oh and arm pain as well. These symptoms persisted through most of the day following the second vaccine but subsided by day 3.,Neutral

gmxjj1t,You are contradicting yourself because a Big Pharma company that wants to maximize their profit will absolutely love a pandemic and will sell a few billion products more which will far out-weight any payments that they have to do for people that they harm.Assuming that the vaccine is safe and they just have to pay for those one-in-a-million cases where it goes wrong.But if the vaccine isn't safe  and they know that they will murder people - like how Pfizer did with their Meningitis vaccine in Nigeria - of course they won't release their product if they have to pay for the harm that they do.If the government pays for it they have total freedom to throw any experimental poison on the market that they want. They can do what they did in Nigeria and knowingly kill people and will have no repercussions. Imagine giving Big Pharma total freedom and not even requiring them to do the basic required studies.,Positive
gqs3flv,Although the second dose is getting a lot of attention for side effects that's all it is side effects. You might get flu-like symptoms like low fever body aches etc. Just mean your body is working correctly and has implemented a good immune response. Only severe thing right now I've heard is anaphylaxis which is rare and usually happens within 30 min of getting it. If you didn't get it the first time you're probably fine. Youre doing great so don't worry :),Positive

kxce4s,Should I take the vaccine even though I had Covid-19 in November? Hey guys! I'm hoping you guys can help me decide whether or not I should take the vaccine. My phase is coming up next week and my workplace is hosting a vaccination site. I volunteered to help man the site and keep everything running smoothly. Since I volunteered I am allowed to skip to the front of the vaccine line. Normally I am all for vaccines. However I don't want to take a vaccine away from someone else if I don't need it. I contracted the virus last November from an essential worker I am housemates with. I was quarantined and sick for about 2 weeks before recovering and feeling normal again. Would recovering from the virus itself be comparable to what I would receive from the vaccine or is there some added benefit that would come only from the vaccine?

giiac5v,1. The vaccine is against viral spike protein NOT against ACE2 receptors. You've been reading bad science by bad actors who don't care about your health. 5.92 million Americans and 1.59 million Israelis have received these vaccines and are safe. There has been to my knowledge one case of encephalitis in Mexico. There have been on the other hand dozens of cases of encephalitis with COVID. If nothing else compels you think of this logically: COVID is a virus with a cell membrane envelope COVID genes (RNA) and multiple proteins including the spike proteinThe COVID vaccine is an artificial membrane with spike protein RNA. When COVID enters your cells it uses its RNA to make more of its proteins including SPIKE protein. Because your cells are the beautiful product of evolution they recognize SPIKE and other proteins to be foreign and show them to immune cells so they can generate an immune response to the proteins. The same thing happens with the vaccine except the vaccine is only a few copies of mRNA that don't have the copy to reproduce themselves like a virus does as it spreads throughout your lungs throat and body. The immune system doesn't care whether the protein comes from the virus or the vaccine because that's the point of the vaccine to expose your body to an element of the virus without exposing you to the actual virus. There is no way whatsoever that the vaccine is more dangerous for you than the virus.,Neutral

gjr61y2,People die and are seriously maimed in automobile accidents every day but does that stop you from getting in a car?[5000 people choke to death in the US every year]( but does that stop you from eating?There is inherent danger in everything.  Yes there IS a chance of something bad happening due to the vaccine.  But there is also danger due to getting COVID.  The vaccine gives your body a chance to figure out how to fight COVID without it trying to take over your cells.  Yes many of the symptoms of COVID are felt due to the body's fighting the virus (or vaccine) but when infected by the virus itself the virus is actively destroying your body at the same time as fighting the virus.  So even IF the vaccine does cause the body some harm it's likely that it's less harm than the virus itself would cause.I've already chosen to take my chances with the vaccine.,Negative

gk8pk5f,I (42F) got my first Pfizer dose yesterday (about 20 hours ago) and my experience was really similar. Right after the injection -which was painless- I had a bit of a panic attack which is normal for me and injections. I stayed 25 minutes to be watched. When I got home I experienced a pressure under my sternum that lasted maybe two hours I got fatigued about 3 hours after the shot and I (still) have a metallic taste in my mouth. I struggled with temperature control through the night and only got about 4 hours of sleep. Overall I'm doing pretty good today- I feel like I have some idea of what to expect in 3 weeks and am making sure I've got meds to address the symptoms.,Positive

gpi0oxn,This doesn’t help for your current pain but you can do it for the next one: my friend gave me the tip to move my arm a ton after my first shot (raise it turn it reach shift it forward and back etc) like every 5 minutes and I did that and the soreness was greatly diminished after one day and nonexistent the second morning I woke up. She did not do this with her first shot and was very sore for 3-4 days. She did it with her second and was good after 1.5.,Positive
gwsrmcn,You’re in ur own right to get the vaccine or not get it but the reason is so if we catch covid cause it isn’t going away ever u don’t get severe symptoms. For the people who actually can’t get vaccines were basically carrying them on our shoulders by getting the vaccine so they don’t have to worry about everyone spreading it to them because they physically can’t get the vaccine. Herd immunity protects those at the most risk of dying from covid so it’s pretty selfish not to get it but u have the freedom to be selfish and not get it I’m not hoping to change ur mind I’m just answering.,Neutral

Had to take two days off of work for it. Took around 4 days to feel better. Two of my coworkers got their second shot a day ago and are perfectly fine. They’ve been taking Tylenolaspirin around the clock and even before the shot(which I didn’t do). They are also older than me by a decade. Everyone reacts differently so it’s hard to say who will go through what.Honestly the side effects leave just as fast as they appear. It’s crazy. She should be good in 24 hours.

I figured maybe reaction to the shot but I didn’t have any breathing problems or numbness in my tongue. Went to bed next morning my whole chest and neck was feeling numb and tingling.

gn3qby4,If you have COVID it wouldn’t be from the vaccine it impossible. However the symptoms are likely and it’s just your bodies immune response and learning to fight the virus. I wouldn’t worry! Be thankful you were one of the lucky ones to get the vaccine so early.,Neutral

gntcg4s,I get hives after my annual flu jab for me it’s a really common side effect and I’m surprised I haven’t had it after getting my 1st dose Pfizer (on Monday). Hives can be a histamine response (so an allergy response) yes but they can also be ‘autoimmune’ hives as in the body’s OTT immune system response. So it doesn’t mean you’re having an allergic reaction - it can just be that you having an immune reaction. Which is really the point of the jabs after all! But some people respond more dramatically than others lol especially after their second dose.Obviously let your doctor know but dw it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re allergic.,Neutral
ghttfat,Ok I will comment again when I do have more information. To get the first dose I had to sign a form saying that I have not had COVID within 90 days and that I have not received any other vaccines within 14 days and I would not have been given the vaccine if I did not sign it. I was assuming they would not give me the form next time but I do not know. My boss is in my vaccine group though (5 of us got it together and were supposed to return together) and I will have to tell her my diagnosis on Monday so she will know of course. I was doing vsafe too but the last time I received the text message check in was on Tuesday. I tried to click on it again yesterday but it says I already completed the check in which is true since I did do it Tuesday. Not sure why it stopped for me.

gmx3enm,Here's the thing...we don't yet know for certain if all of the COVID-19 vaccines out there will prevent you from passing the disease to someone else once you're vaccinated.The phase III trials that were conducted for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were not setup to consider the impact on transmission only the impact on symptomatic disease. For the latter endpoint we got some excellent results but we obviously got nothing for the former.That doesn't mean that the vaccines _don't_ stop you from transmitting the virus to others once you're vaccinated there's just no data to confirm it because the trials were never supposed to show it. EPerhaps in the future some data will demonstrate an impact or a lack of impact. Until then the CDC and all other public health institutions are making people aware that there's no evidence yet of an impact on transmission only on symptomatic disease.,Neutral
ghx81gc,The science behind this vaccine is so flawed it makes no since that your body should internally make something that a virus creates on its own it seems if your own immune cells are making the antigen of the virus the antibodies that are created from that will either be auto immune and attack the antigen your making or do nothing when the real virus comes. Your mingling this viral RNA with your immune system this is not a vaccine this is symbiosis with a virus you better trust your instincts and stop being a guinea pig. The people with no side effects don’t care about who dies or has bad reactions. The people who aren’t having reactions are gonna keep taking this vaccine annually and fill thier cells with so much viral rna thier gonna snap and possibly even mutate,Neutral
gsruima,Ive heard fevers are common. Havent had the vaccine yet but I know that the fever could simply be an immune response meaning that the vaccine is working and doing its job.

m1ydve,Yet Another 1st Vaccine Post and What I Did To Try and Mitigate the Side Effects: Patient's Log Male. 70. On a good day I ache all over and bruise easily.**Day 1**Appointment at Walmart pharmacy. Moderna. Arrive 5 minutes early. 5 minutes later I was done. While waiting out the 15 minute observation period I walked around in sight (much to the chagrin of the Walmart associates who advised that I remain seated) and I kept my arm mostly moving and lightly massaged it. Began pounding Gatorade Pedialyte (electrolytes) and water throughout the day.  Afterwards at home I began to apply alternating hot and cold compresses both day and evening. Arm was mildly sore throughout the day. I ate lunch and dinner without consequences. Took one generic 500mg acetaminophen pill after dinner. Rest of the day and evening I was either on the computer or watching television. Oh yeah I also borrowed *ahem* my SO's personal massager and used that multiple times on my arm during the day and evening.**Day 2**While sleepy yesterday I willed myself to avoid napping. I wanted to be dead tired when I went to sleep at 11:00pm last night. My alarm is always set to 5:00am and I usually get up between 5 and 6. When the alarm sounded I slammed it off and got outta bed around 6:30am.  I was anticipating the dreaded arm soreness this morning but it was only mild soreness throughout the range of arm movements with the exception of trying to lift my arm over my head so I stopped trying to lift my arm over my head. No fever.**Day 3**My arm is barely sore. I resumed exercising today after foregoing the day before the vaccine and the two days since. Full 50 minute aerobic workout that I do approx. 4x a week. Took temperature an hour later. Not elevated. No further side effects. While I have read that some side effects can begin a week plus after the shot I am declaring (kiss of death) that I did not get whacked by the first dose. Not looking forward to the second dose a month from now.,Neutral

gqgv8l3,"I keep seeing similar questions about safety of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines particularly in regard to this concept of weighted risk; many young healthy people who are unlikely to get severely ill or die from COVID-19 infection are wondering why they should risk long-term effects from injecting themselves with a new vaccine technology. Most of the concern here seems to be around long-term reproductive health. Herd immunity is an obvious goal that's been discussed at length but people understandably have limits to what they're willing to sacrifice for the good of others. I'd like to take a really thorough stab at assuaging some of that fear and help give decision makers a better understanding of the weighted risk trade off of COVID-19 infection vs vaccine.Disclosure: I am a public health education professional with academic background and personal interest in microbiology as well as much professional experience in communicable disease control. I am not a doctor and I cannot give you medical advice.The first bit of background that I think many people are missing is what a virus is and how it interacts with a host. Let's take a quick trip back to basic human biology: Our bodies contain a gazillion different types of living cells that perform all types of different jobs - some convert food into energy some fight off invading pathogens some help transmit electric impulses so we can move our muscles etc. A cell does what it does because its genetic material tells it so. Viruses which are not living organisms consist of genetic material encapsulated in a protein shell. The virus usually has some sort of key mechanism in its capsule that helps it break open or break into living cells. Once it finds a cell it can ""open"" the virus inserts its genetic material corrupting the cell's own genetic material telling the cell to stop doing the work it’s supposed to do and instead use it's own resources to create copies of the virus. Eventually the cell releases all the newly created virus copies which go on to infect and take over other cells in your body.**The key takeaway from this is that a virus by very definition 1- is genetic material and 2 - corrupts your cells' genetic material**. Moving on to mRNA vaccines...As most people know by now mRNA vaccines work by introducing a *piece* of the virus' genetic material into the body. Your immune cells learn how to fight this (harmless) invader through trial and error and ultimately remember what works to contain and destroy. The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines use the piece of the virus' genetic material that codes for the spike protein which is that key mechanism I mentioned earlier. This is a great plan for two reasons: 1 - That spike protein can open a lot of doors on a lot of cells. This is part of what makes the virus such a formidable foe. 2 - Most mutations of the virus still have this spike protein so your body likely can recognize many future variants by this feature.So let's weigh the risk of viral infection against the risk of unintended vaccine effects: |**Viral infection** |**Vaccine** ||:-|:-||*The entire* virus genetic  material is in your body. This genetic material is coded to corrupt a cell’s genetic material to create copies of a complete virus wreaking all sorts of havoc before our immune system can respond *because that’s what a virus does.                                   *************************************              The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is *complete* genetic material that we *know*   messes with all sorts of cells in your body causing possibly permanent damage   to your lungs heart brain… and that’s just what we know about. **It is entirely likely that other systems   are affected too and we just won’t know about all the long-term impacts of   even mild infection for many many years.** **Even if the infected person only experiences mild   symptoms or is asymptomatic the virus has still entered their cells and   caused some damage somewhere. There’s no way to say whether the impact of   asymptomatic infection will be seen later in a person’s life**. |*A piece* of virus genetic material is in your body. This genetic material is coded to corrupt a cell’s function to create copies of a piece of the virus before our immune system can respond. **The piece can’t really do anything without the rest of the virus’ genetic code so it floats around   harmless until our immune system learns to destroy it.** |I’m just going to copy and paste this again because it’s the reason why EVERYONE who is eligible should get vaccinated for COVID-19:**Even if the infected person only experiences mild symptoms or is asymptomatic the virus has still entered their cells and caused some damage somewhere. There’s no way to say whether the impact of asymptomatic infection will be seen later in a person’s life**.**If you are worried about pieces of genetic material causing long-term effects** (which hopefully you now understand can't happen because its not coded to do anything aside from creating a spike protein)** know that there are far more pieces of genetic material in a full virus than there are in the fragment used in an mRNA vaccine.**Get vaccinated.",Positive

lbte80,To everyone hesitantworried about the Covid Vaccine here’s why you shouldn’t be. The number of people vaccinated against Covid in the US is currently 26.5 million. This is MORE than the total number of people who have contracted the disease itself. Anyway the CDC lists 191 “deaths after vaccine”. Now keep in mind ZERO of these deaths were confirmed to be related to the vaccine and many or all of the deaths are inline with the general population. For example out of 26.5 million people some are going to die due to other unrelated causes. But for the sake of statistics let’s just say that the 191 deaths are directly caused by the vaccine. This will make the chance of dying due to the vaccine 0.00072%. Now There have been 26.2 million people infected with Covid in the US so far and 458691 deaths. That’s a 1.75% chance of death. Which risk would you rather take?EDIT: One more thing if you are young and reading this thinking “I am not at risk for the virus so I won’t take the vaccine” think again. I am 19 years old so I decided to use my own age group of 15-24. Between 11 and 123 (the span of 23 days) there have been 537 deaths in my age group. That’s is nearly 5 times more than the total “possible” death from vaccine number which applies to all ages and a much much larger time frame. In the same 23 day span there have also been 2335 deaths in the age group of 25-34 and 6139 deaths in the age group of 35-44. The number of deaths continues to increase as we increase each age group. This is from the CDC website- you can see this data here: ,Positive

SARS-cov-2 pacients were tested and the conclusion was that after 8 months since the infection they still had antibodies. Other than that - ""no data"".And specifically for your case you should really isolate if you don't have symptoms that require hospitalization.",Positive
gstlzht,Happened to me starting 3 days after first Pfizer. Seems to be getting better off and on. Day 16 now,Positive
glhuxdx,Yeah I guess whatever “facts” you throw at me I’m still going to feel sadness for those that do die of COVID or suffer from it- especially those who develop life-altering long term symptoms (permanent lung damage chronic fatigue neurological issues to name a few). I would rather have a bleeding heart than a bitter one 😘,Neutral

getkbg8,Errrrrr no that’s not the case that’s absolute rubbish.Firstly no one know when the vaccine runs out and when you are not protected anymore that means you could be walking around thinking you’re protected but you’re not so you could still pass the virus on.Secondly there is no evidence someone who’s vaccinated cannot still shed.Thirdly this is most important and what many get completely wrong a COVID vaccine only helps fight off infection it doesn’t mean the virus can’t enter your body as they’re already said it won’t work for everyone.Plus you need the virus to enter your body for the vaccine to kick into action the misconception about vaccines is you have a jab and you’re 95% protected from getting the virus when it’s you’re 95% not to have serious symptoms or any symptoms that’s a huge difference.Plus the 95% rubbish is based on a small subset not millions of people so infection rates will be higher.So yes if you don’t need it don’t have it as there are risks both medical and physiological.,Neutral
gqhslbo,Everyone I know who has gone bc they are eligible has reported that they are not asking for anything at actual vaccination sites (including private pharmacies) besides ID.

This tracks with everything I’ve heard.,Neutral
ggt0idt,I got it at 2 pm Tuesday and haven't had any side effects other than injection arm pain. Pain has increased and seems to radiate into the muscles in my right shoulderneck. Last night I had pain in the opposite arm as well. No fever chills nausea or headache so far.,Neutral

gorhef0,Nope. Just a perfectly healthy 3 month old who has reached most of his milestone a head of schedule. We know of 5 other mothers personally that got vaccinated while breastfeeding. No issues. Plus there have been 100s now through my wife’s hospital without issues. I will tell you this though. There has been 7 pregnant woman die this year with covid at the hospital. In the ten years before covid only 2 deaths. My wife was scheduled to get her vaccine while pregnant but our baby came three weeks early and the day before her vaccine appt. Every Dr she spoke to at the hospital and outside recommended her to get it.This is also from Harvard medical:What to consider about COVID-19 vaccines if you’re breastfeedingExperts including the WHO believe it is most likely safe to get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine if you’re breastfeeding. Although breastfeeding people were not included in the vaccine trials the mechanism of mRNA vaccines and experience from other vaccines suggest this is true.It is important to know:There is no virus in the mRNA vaccines. You cannot get COVID or give your baby COVID by being vaccinated. The components of the vaccine are not known to harm breastfed infants.When you receive the vaccine the small mRNA vaccine particles are used up by your muscle cells at the injection site and thus are unlikely to get into breast milk. Any small mRNA particles that reach the breast milk would likely be digested.When a person gets vaccinated while breastfeeding their immune system develops antibodies that protect against COVID-19. These antibodies can be passed through breast milk to the baby. Newborns of vaccinated mothers who breastfeed can benefit from these antibodies against COVID-19.,Positive

gk578ge,I do not have MS I am O neg though. First round with moderna was easy. My arm only got mildly sore it felt like I got a shot in my arm. I didn't need meds with it and I bounced back relatively quickly.I got the second shot Wednesday and probably about 4 hours after the shot I felt the wave of pain come over me. I  also could only raise my arm slightly. I took meds and tried sleeping but my arm got so intensely painful that I woke up and couldn't fall back asleep. I took some ibuprofen iced my arm and eventually did fall back asleep. Next day the pain was moderately still there but got kinda mild as the day went on. I can barely get my arm up to my chest but can't keep it there for very long. I think I'm beginning to come around though.,Neutral

I have a feeling I’m going to go home and be on edge waiting for something bad to happen (I mean some people are a stuck in bed feeling like shit not much to look forward to since that could happen so yeah I’m apprehensive). As much as I normally don’t like to brush people off and say “it’s just anxiety” I do think it’s very possible you are just very anxious because ya know new vaccine waiting for side effects so much talk about it etc.Having said that I know some people report tachycardia after the vaccine so perhaps it is indeed a vaccine reaction.

gh9t0nh,There should be no more concern than any new drug or covid itself. Based on the hundred of thousands that already got it short term effects aren’t concerning..... obviously long term affects are a mystery but than again so is covid itself. Pfizer has some of the best scientists in the world. They aren’t part of some new world order conspiracy. They want to make money and be successful. Killing a bunch of people would be real bad for business. So yes you should be concerned but putting in perspective many people put way worse things in their body without a care on the world......and all the social media and blogger experts who have never looked through a microscope are fearless of covid but terrified of the vaccine....the irony...those are complete idiots and it’s sad that this is the extent of some people’s research.,Neutral

glh4b2v,I had first Pfizer vaccination eight days ago.  First 48 hours felt ok-ish - tired and weak but nothing awful.  I then went to work and nearly passed out so was sent home.  I am very fatigued weak muscles fuzzylightheaded tingling hands and feet and other aches and wobbliness. Hands have felt like they don't belong to me since the start which is odd.  Can't stand up for more than a minute or so without having to sit down. Saw Doc on day 6 - checked out heart lungs and BP.  She was loathe to connect my symptoms to the vaccine and suggested I book a blood test for next week and cancel it if I feel better in the meantime. I am very pro Vax fit 59 year-old F who is not generally hysterical re health but I'm getting quite weepy now.

lcggxj,Second dose today! Hey everyone As excited as I am to get the vaccine I have also been terrified that something bad would happen to me. I have terrible anxiety and I’m always worried I’m dying lol. So decided to make this thread to talk about my expierience and maybe help someone else who might be a little scared.  Some info: I work in a hospital where I was able to get vaccinated (on the clock woohoo!) I’m allergic to penicillin the only thing I get is hives.I got my first dose of moderna on Jan. 4th. No side effects at all! Only a sore arm for 2 days and a bit itchy around the injection site. I just got my second dose the nurse told me that this needle is a bit bigger than the last one. Not sure if thats standard or not but it wasnt bad. I’m being monitored for 30 mins for any allergic reaction. I have a nurse coming in to check on me every 5 mins or so. So far so good.Update: 2 hours after the vaccine and I’m ok! My arm definitely hurts (like last time) and I have a very slight headache. Will update again after lunch! :)update: my. arm. is. killing. me . That is all :)another update it is about 6 hours in and I have a pretty crazy headache I’m really tired and just want to sleep. Will update in a few hours again!Currently 8 pm about 11 hours or so post vaccine. Not feeling too good but not horrible. My headache did not go away after some Tylenol and a nap my arm hurts like all hell and I feel in general a bit “achey” and crappy but it’s manageable. I’m gonna shower and head back to bed will update in the morning.Update: morning guys! Last night was a bit rough but I feel much better this morning. My temp went up to 100.3 (not quite a fever) I was quite nauseous with body aches and chills. And the headache was probably the worst part. Around 10pm I took a dayquil (nyquil knocks me out for tooooo long lol) and went to bed. It helped a lot and I was able to sleep well. I woke up this morning and still have body aches and that’s about it. I called out of work because I want to shake these body aches off with some rest.

gkdoqw9,I’ll put it this way. My sister (young) was completely healthy prior to getting COVID in March. She was almost put on a ventilator and now has systolic heart failure with an EF of 19%. Cancer can happen to anyone and so I dont think that would be linked to a vaccination. Correct me if Im wrong but as far as I know vaccines don’t cause any damaging long term side effects. Youre in more danger if you contract COVID because you have no idea how your body will respond to the virus. My point is- there are so many other toxins and harmful things in this world that can damage your body I wouldn’t worry about the vaccine being one of them.,Neutral
gn9jrge,For starters people taking these shots are their guinea pigs this is their clinical trials they just didn't mention that part.

gj27tde,I’d suggest doing a bit of independent research through academic articles if you can! In short: I’m a healthcare professional and did my own research as well as having background knowledge of vaccines and diseases. I am typically very sensitive to vaccines. I decided to get it. The benefits of the vaccine (preventing COVID infection) by far out weigh the potential risks of the vaccine (side effects). You are right that an mRNA vaccine is new. Keep in mind though that COVID-19 is already an RNA virus. As you may have heard there are a number of individuals who have experienced serious long term consequences as a result of COVID-19 infection. That’s just not a risk I am willing to accept any longer. Fear is no way to live your life. Sure it’s a scary time but educating yourself using the appropriate resources (research articles) is your best bet. Reddit can be great but as you can see you will get lots of people with lots of opinions! :) One thing that stands out to me is that a number of (non health care) wealthy individuals and conservative politicians (who had previously expressed skepticism to the vaccine) are jumping at the opportunity to get the vaccine. That speaks volumes. Good luck to you!,Positive

gl32sq2,I work in a hospital which is how I came to be vaccinated. I asked this very question to the nurse who administered my 2nd dose. I was told that the booster is different than the initial as far as dosage (not sure if that’s true). They told us that they also only ordered the number of doses for the 2nd shot that corresponded with the number of people who got the initial so that any waste would be minimal. I told them it was a shame that others couldn’t get a first dose while the rest of us got our 2nd. She may have been full of it though.,Neutral

gpnnde3,I think it's very fair to assume that things went very bad for her after getting it maybe if she had headaches and a fever before then we could completely rule out the vaccine. And i'm not saying the vaccine will only do harm to everyone 94% success rate but unfortunately i happen to know someone in the 6%. Every medicine has its side effects and every person reacts differently. I am not a conspiracy theorist or an anti vaxxer so i have no reason to exaggerate or make the vaccine look bad my mother in law happily took it! she posted a picture of her getting it and posted on facebook that it was her early birthday gift she got it the day before her birthday. We are just in disbelief that she expired so fast when the only thing in her routine that changed was adding the vaccine. As a nurse you should know 100% that not everyone will survive this or any vaccine. I just wanted to know if anyone has a similar story with similar symptoms after taking the vaccine becuase loss of memory diarrhea and falling down seems very very strange to me but as I said every body reacts differently.

Today I noticed that the veins on the back of my hand (not the side I got the vaccine on) suddenly became large and pronounced—the color seems to be normal but I was wondering if this could be a vaccine side effect or if it was more likely a result of some physical action like typing (sometimes working a lot with my hands causes the veins to become a bit bigger)?The vein size has come down a tiny bit but I was wondering if anyone’s experienced this with the vaccine.

gsoh39l,Side effects just mean the vaccine is working. Your immune system is going berserk at the Messenger RNA.,Negative
gjr1bqd,The mRNA is taken up by cells local to where the injection was. So mainly muscle and fat cells in your arm. Those are the cells that make the spike protein and present it on the cell membrane for immune cells to recognize as foreign. The mRNA itself degrades rather quickly as do the spike proteins made by your bodies own cells. None of what you said is an actual concern or has anything to do with the real mechanism of the vaccine.

gj20sxd,I dont think that the government is being sinister necessarily but I do think it is dangerous and very undertested to push out an experimental vaccine at warp speed. When SARS came out they tried to make an mRNA vaccine for 20 years but the manufacturers would not approve them for humans. Now that the government is overseeing the whole experience they say its good to go right away. I dont think that is very comforting. At 24 it is highly unlikely you are in any real danger from covid anyway and kids dont even carry it really. You are in a fairly safe scenario statistically.Long-term inflammatory markers from having covid can be countered fairly easily with a range of supplements medications and diet alterations. mRNA causing proteins to form where they don't belong however or an autoimmune disorder which was what happened in ferrets with the SARS vaccines... that's a different matter altogether so I don't recommend it for young people personally.,Neutral

ggrq0iu,My understanding is that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are very similar. They're both mRNA vaccines so they have the same mechanism of action where they. They're both two-shot regimens. They have the same effectiveness rate in the ~94-95% range. They have the same common side effects of headache painsoreness in the vaccination arm and to a much lower extent chillsfever. Their ingredients list is also very similar. Neither of them have any preservatives like thimerosol. No latex (for people who have latex allergies). No eggs are used in either process (so unlike something like most flu shots you can take this with an egg allergy). You can check out the Pfizer vaccine ingredients at  and the Moderna vaccine ingredients at  .The only real difference I can think of is the logistical challenge of the Pfizer vaccine needing to be stored at a much lower temperature than the Moderna vaccine (which itself also needs to be stored at a really cold temperature just not as cold).  I guess you could also argue about the differences in funding between each vaccine but that's not a clinical issue.My knee jerk reaction is that I would take the one that is first available to you whether it's the Pfizer vaccine or the Moderna vaccine. I don't see an obvious reason why one would be better than the other right now.,Neutral

Someone else did mention and if it came up following vaccine I wouldn’t over stress it but under normal circumstances a clavicle lymph node enlargement is more concerning than say a axillary or groin enlargement.  But since you just got your vaccine while I’m not a doctor I would think this is your immune system responding. In the event it lingers after your second dose might be worth mentioning to your doctor.I’ve had two removed that thankfully have been clear. I feel very grateful❤️,Positive

gjzqod0,"At my healthcare facility they would not even allow you to schedule it earlier than 3 weeks for Pfizer and 4 weeks for Moderna because getting it earlier would affect efficacy. My scheduled 2nd shot is 4 weeks to the day for the Moderna I received at the end of December. They suggested we get it as close to the suggested time frame as possible but said that getting it later would not be a significant problem. I'd guess based on this that if you get it at 6 weeks vs. 4 you should be OK. But you can always call the facility at which you are getting the second dose to make sure you are within recommended timeframes.From the CDC website: ""You should **get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 1-month interval as possible.** However there is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. You should **not** get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval.""

I feel a lot better today and am now a bit more than 48 hours out. The weirdest side effect I have that is still pretty bad is 'brain zaps.' This is something I've experienced when I've forgotten to take my SSRIs and is basically like a momentary buzzing in my brain. They don't last too long but they do occur often in quick succession. They're not painful just off-putting and a little freaky and distracting. Has anyone else had these after their vaccine??I haven't forgotten my meds recently although I *have* been tapering down my dose for the last 10 days (under the direction of my psychiatrist).

lootce,My Moderna Experience Completed both Moderna doses...my experienceMy Moderna experience... Have now had both rounds. Round 1:-45 minutes after I started to feel some neck stiffness. Took some ibuprofen &amp; used a heating pad &amp; that helped. Ibuprofen before bed to prevent arm soreness in the morning-Morning after ~15hours later I my arm felt really stiff &amp; sore but keeping it moving really helped! I felt really fatigued for a couple of days but other than that round 1 went okay. Just went for round 2 on Tuesday...-Neck stiffness came on much quicker this time within 20 minutes. Again heat &amp; ibuprofen helped. -about an hr later once I got home I got hit with a pretty intense wave of nausea (I’m a chronic migraine patient so I already have a nausea script on hand. Took some of that)-I switched arms this time going with my dominate arm hoping that the increased movement would help with the soreness however with round 2 the soreness was MUCH more intense. -Over a period of 2 days I had extreme fatigue nausea low fever chills body aches a headache (not migraine just a very persistent headache) that wouldn’t go away &amp; I just felt sort of out of it. -I stayed home the first day after the vaccine. I work in healthcare &amp; the majority of the office has been vaccinated with either Moderna or Pfizer so being out of commission your first day after the 2nd dose has become kind of expected. -Day 2 I went back to work but ended up leaving around 2 because I couldn’t stand the hot &amp; cold feeling and the nausea. -Today 4th day out and I’m still dealing with a slightly sore arm but I can sleep on my side relatively comfortably now! Overall not too bad! A word of advice: be sure you have the following on hand:-Tylenol-Ibuprofen-Pedialyte-Heating pad for any stiffness-Benadryl in case of itchiness or redness at injection site-Ice pack for injection site soreness!Also if you are US based the CDC is tracking vaccine reactions with their V-Safe program they will text you daily reminders to complete your post vaccine check in.

lj9iay,"Cold water poured on any enthusiasm about vaccine bringing ""normal life"" back Last night on the Coronavirus Daily podcast [which can be played here]( there was an interview with Dr. Paul Duprex the director at the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh.He informed everyone of their recent studies explaining they show how COVID is perpetually spreadable and always mutates to shed part of its DNA etc. His argument is that we'll need to keep making new vaccines and taking protective measures perpetually--to sum it up this life of masks distancing closed venues and isolation will continue for many years. From his attitude it sounded like this is a big joke to him. So nice that he got so much entertainment out of assuring everyone their lives are truly canceled. **But of course he left out a few pieces of data so I'm still unclear on why he knows something nobody else does. For example:**- Pfizer and Moderna if I understand are continually stating that the vaccines (as of now) are designed to act against most micro-mutationsvariants of the virus and would still be moderately effective against other major strains. **But this Doctor set them straight by saying that his recent experiment means COVID will always escape the vaccines.**- For as long as I remember 60-70% was the goal for vaccine effectiveness--and also the estimate for how many people should be immune for ""herd immunity."" **This guy said that if only 70% of people take the vaccine (even this is more than I thought agreed to it) that this wouldn't lead to herd-immunity and therefore herd-immunity will never happen.** I'm no mathematician but if the vaccines are supposedly 94% effective and 70% take it that ""protects"" 65% right there. So is there a reason why everything we've been told is wrong and this dude knows the true numbers but doesn't bother to explain himself?How can there be such a discrepancy here? And why is the media (as well as the most prolific doctors and companies) still portraying ""cautious optimism"" instead of being honest and freaking out over this?  Any theories?",Positive

gik8iuq,"You are part of a clinical trial. You are there to find out and report back to them if there is a problem with the methodology they use on you. If you didn't want a risk of a reaction why did you sign up to be part of a clinical trial? There is always an increased risk with a second dose but to determine a recommended dose size for their exact cocktail they do clinical trials. You are that trial. The dose size isnt the problem it's the exact ingredient cocktail and exactly how it was made. If you had a shot of beer and a shot of tequila being evaluated you would say 4 shots of beer is no big deal and they can legally drive. Another person goes and says ""Well its alcohol just like the other shots"" and they drink 4 shots of tequila and get a DUI. Is there more of a risk of getting an effect by drinking another shot of alcohol? Sure. That's how it works. You drink more you get more effect. How high or low the risk is isn't determined by the size of the shot but the density of the ingredients.In the case of a vaccine like this there are a lot more factors to ""effect"" than just amount of ingredient as well. It is complicated. Even if they told you the amount you dont know what the units of measurement even mean. Determining a recommended dosage is what clinical trials are for.

It's lies. The mask wearing social distancing lockdowns will not stop as they make up rubbish about variants from tweaked data and the need for booster shots every year. I am being genuine when I say that there is a lot of information out there that is not coming from the greedy vaccine companies or the psychopaths who want to cull the population that reveals that Covid the lockdowns and the 'vaccines' are part of an evil operation that is part of a bigger overall agenda. They'll do anything to get everyone to take these toxins including offering donuts and cannabis.

gjvc0kc,55M.  First dose 4 wks ago slightly sore arm. Nothing more.  Second dose 1 week ago. I missed one day of work due to fatigue headaches sweats and generalized body aches.  Since then I have had intermittent dull headaches and I am still a bit more tired than my baseline but I have been able to work four 10-12 hour shifts without great difficulty.  Oddly my arm is not sore from the second dose.  Tolerable side effects. I would MUCH rather go through this than take a chance on lung scarring permanent cognitive deficits cardiac damage blood clots strokes or death from catching Corona.  11million chance of serious vaccine side effect.  1100 chance of dying from Covid.

gspcgr3,No but I heard on my local news that you will pass antibodies on to your child and they said it was a good thing that will protect them second hand like other immunity you provide through breast feeding.  I’d ask your doctor what they think. Personally if I were breast feeding I would 100% get the vaccine to help protect my child because I feel the side effects of covid could be much worse than the vaccine. Kids don’t often have covid symptoms but when they do they can be very serious or deadly. So that terrifies me more. But you have to do what feels right for you. Maybe pump a couple days worth of extra milk if you are worried about the actual vaccine being passed in your breast milk. Then after that it will just be antibodies not the actual drug. I wouldn’t do it this way...I would like as much immunity as I could get in my baby. But this might be a good alternative if you are worried.  Good luck mama!,Positive

Of course if you have been following this sub you have seen a good amount posts from folks who had minor issues. I'm one of those people.  63 yo male got my 2nd Moderna last Thursday so I am on day 6. I had a sore arm for about 36 hours with  1 and that was it. With  2 I had a super sore arm for about the same amount of time and a very mild headache. I also had some moments of chills during this same time but they weren't constant. At the  moment I know 7 people who have now had a 2nd shot and only one got hit hard and she had Covid  about 5 or 6 months ago. Interesting she got hit on both vaccines but it was the first one that hit her the hardest. Don't take any pre-meds before and only take them after and whenif really needed.

The cdc actually determined which jobs post what level risks to individuals to ensure that the vaccine when out to those who need it the most. I can’t social distance in my job. I didn’t cut in front of health care workers when they started receiving their vaccines last month because “my life matters too”. Everyone’s life matters and we need to wait our turn.

The process was not rushed it was put to the top of the “to-do” list so to speak as it was top priority. That’s why most vaccines take much more time than this one there’s a larger wait period for review. Those vaccines aren’t necessarily being studied or worked on more they’re simply waiting on a longer line for review.

gnind0c,No GCSE23 is right. Approval and emergency authorization are not the same thing. This technology has been around for about 10 years. Moderna has never been able to get full FDA approval for any vaccine or therapy using this mRNA technology. So if you get the vaccine understand that you are basically participating in the biggest medical experiment ever conducted. Maybe you’re okay with that I’m not judging. To each their own. But I don’t feel like they’ve been completely transparent about these vaccines how they work and the criticisms of their clinical trials have been widely suppressed. Good luck. ✌🏻,Positive

kkoh5x,This vaccine is no walk in the park (and why that’s good) Hey guysI’m in a Pfizer trial right now and got my second dose of what I assume is the vaccine on 1222. I had read all the articles about the side effects being no fun and lemme just say-they’re no fun. I had a fever fatigue nausea diarrhea and loss of appetite. And I was thrilled about that. Immune responses are not usually fun. I generally don’t feel well after most vaccines but I assume that’s because my immune system is responding as expected. I’m young and generally healthy so I def get a stronger immune response than some. On the bright side I’m probably covered now!Please try to get the vaccine on a day where you can rest. I found that my symptoms started around 8 hours post shot and they lasted a solid 72 hours. Not a fun time.,Positive

So after that I started getting the flu shot and have been doing it for almost 20 years now.I got the Covid vaccine because I thought about my flu experience and decided the prospects of getting myself or someone else really sick from Covid were much more likely than a possible side effect that so far (it's going to be getting close to a year for some research participants) hasn't come about.,Negative

My parents found one covid vaccine distribution center in my state that gives vaccines to kids and they registered me to get the vaccine at the last available slot.

Especially considering that four people in my house my parents and grandparents already got the vaccine. In addition I rarely go out and when I do I social distance and wear an N95 mask (my mom gave me one because she got some N95s from her university since she's a nursing student).

lu2r4v,My wife and I just got the first dose of the Moderna vaccine So here’s our vaccine update. We (Amber and I) received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. So I am 46 my wife is 31 and we live in Indiana. I was called by the VA this past Wednesday and told it was my turn to get my first vaccine dose and that I would be receiving the Moderna vaccine. They initially asked me to come in on Thursday but because of some scheduling issues my appointment was ultimately set for Friday (yesterday). I was also told that my wife could get vaccinated at the same time as me since I am a disabled veteran and she is my caregiver. Here’s how it went. The process was quick and easy the needle was small and the injection itself didn’t hurt at all. My wife has had zero negative symptoms since getting vaccinated. Around 7pm yesterday so 8 hours after getting vaccinated I began to get a fever chills and headache basically feeling like I was coming down with flu and my arm on the injection side felt like someone had run over it with a truck. I took some Tylenol and just rested until bedtime. Woke up this morning with no symptoms other than my arm still being a little sore. Other than that we have had no issues and are already in the schedule to get our second dose at the end of March. Feel free to ask questions.,Neutral

They all said I should get the second one. Now that I have experienced hypoxia for more than a week I believe we can put to rest any doubt that the cause of these back-to-back episodes was my immune system's response to the vaccines. All I can imagine is that my immune system caused an inflammatory response in my lungs. I sure hope researchers figure out what part of the vaccines we have reacted to. Otherwise I may have to join the ranks of the anti-vaxxers.

No symptoms or warning signs before the vaccine. Within 6 days her husband who was vaccinated the same day with the same lot of moderna just had to have an emergency appendectomy. Doctors they’ve spoken with say it’s coincidence. I’m asking here because she can’t seem to find an answer anywhere for if they should get their second doses and their doctors won’t advise them one way or the other.

I hope this doesn’t interfere with anything I am so itchy and embarrassed to go to work or see anyone (which is fine because covid times ) but still... I can’t take it and Benadryl makes me so out of it. The hives are a late reaction it seems like and initially I had only the chills and body aches 24-48 hours post injection. Then the lip swelling and then the next day- hives on my face arms legs back butt  stomach thighs - everywhere.

m0ydsy,I'm a bit worried about getting a Covid vaccine and have some questions I'm 27 male and relatively healthy. Moderately overweight but with no underlying health conditions except a bit higher than normal cholesterol. I live in BC Canada. Canada is the only country in the world that has decided to delay the second dose of the vaccine to a 4 month period in order to get more people vaccinated.I'm a bit skeptical of this decision but I was already concerned about the vaccine because companies like Pfizer and Moderna have been granted blanket immunity. This could mean they were incentivized to make a vaccine rather quickly than ensuring people's safety. Currently 4 covid vaccines are approved in Canada: Pfizer Moderna Astrazeneca and Johnson&amp;Johnson. We don't get a choice in which vaccine is available to us. I have some questions: 1. Since we can't choose which vaccine to get what if one vaccine has more occurrences of severe side effects than another? According to figure 2 of this diagram provided by Canada [here]( there have been more serious adverse events with Pfizer than Moderna although granted more people might have been vaccinated with Pfizer. The government is not providing the total number of vaccinations broken down by vaccine type. This will be concerning once Astrazeneca and J&amp;J begin being administered and not knowing the percentage who experience an adverse event afterwards.2. I've read that some people experience severe disease to covid-19 not because of the virus itself but because of an [over-active immune system responding to the virus causes cytokine storms]( [and also rogue antibodies]( Is it possible that a Covid vaccine could cause an over-active immune system or produce lots of rogue antibodies that then make severe disease from Covid-19 a lot worse than if you had gotten Covid-19 without being vaccinated? 3. New Covid variants are spreading. Will we likely have to take new Covid vaccines every year? 4. Long term safety of these vaccines is obviously unknown but historically how common is it for long term side effects to exist after a vaccine? 5. Should I just wait a year before taking it to see its long term effects? I likely would survive Covid if I got it and since everyone else would be vaccinated my likelihood of catching it would be pretty low. I'd like to get back to travelling someday. 6. Will things really go back to normal after getting the vaccine? It seems like there's no plans to lift any safety precautions.,Neutral

gwehcoq,But no vaccine is 100% effective. The mysteries of human biology mean that some vaccinated people will still get sick when exposed to the virus. So far there have been about 7000 such “breakthrough cases” out of the 94 million or so Americans who’ve been fully vaccinated. Overall demand for vaccines is still high but a recent Bloomberg analysis found that in some pockets demand is waning long before a larger percentage of the population has been inoculated.,Neutral

ghxak19,The science behind this vaccine is so flawed it makes no since that your body should internally make something that a virus creates on its own it seems if your own immune cells are making the antigen of the virus the antibodies that are created from that will either be auto immune and attack the antigen your making or do nothing when the real virus comes. Your mingling this viral RNA with your immune system this is not a vaccine this is symbiosis with a virus you better trust your instincts and stop being a guinea pig. The people with no side effects don’t care about who dies or has bad reactions. The people who aren’t having reactions are gonna keep taking this vaccine annually and fill thier cells with so much viral rna thier gonna snap and possibly even mutate.  Children should absolutely not take this vaccine,Neutral

gbwvck2,There been no evidence submitted this vaccine can provide lasting immunity and it probably won’t.Plus IMO the warning signs are on the wall so to speak as it’s proven Covid 19 has passed from humans to mink mutated and passed back into humans carrying that mutation this mutated version is less likely to be target effective with the vaccine.Unless you’ve got underlying health problems or you’re a medic for most people who only have slight symptoms taking a vaccine is like cracking a nut with a sledgehammer it’s over reacting.Facts are there will also be a proportion of the populous who take the vaccine and have a hyper immune response when they do eventually get infected with Covid 19 and those hyper immune responses are worst than if you’d not had any vaccine.Predicting what every humans response to a vaccine will be with a few hundred thousand people in a test  isn’t insurance it takes years before you know for sure something is safe.,Neutral

Whereever you get your second shot you can tell them you experienced severe dizziness with the first one. They should keep an eye on you. Good luck!,Positive
m2t9al,loss of smell after Pfizer vaccine? i (17f) got the Pfizer vaccine yesterday at around 4:10 and i woke up and couldn’t smell? i’ve tired smelling a couple things but unless it’s really strong i can’t smell it. i told my mom and she didn’t seem concerned so i called my cousin who’s fully vaccinated and he said he experienced loss of smell for a day or so too. so basically my question is has anyone else here loss smell either?,Positive
l8xnrn,Moderna 1st dose 127 Vaccine happened at 1 PM 2pm- small dull headache (like when u drink too much champagne wine)5:30pm- little sore to the touch where I got the vaccine but nothing crazy 6:30pm- itchiness subtle ——————Day after (day 2)woke up with soreness at injection site but that’s it. I have full range of motion. ——————Day 3 still sore but not as bad. It’s going away rather quickly —————-Day 4 no more soreness. Back to normal. Ready for vaccine 2!,Negative
gjb0934,Lmao he’s not my boss anymore first of all. Second of all A LOT. The ingredients of the Pfizer vaccine are mRNA lipids (one of which is cholesterol) 4 salts for pH stabilization and table sugar. I have a graduate degree in public health and understand the basic science of the vaccine.,Positive
gf1ypno,The virus that causes COVID-19 is part of the coronavirus family just like influenza and others which infect “ordinary” cells such as the ones that make up the inside of your lungs. In that case a vaccine merely has to mimic the virus in order to trigger your own immune system to attack it.The virus that causes AIDS is a retrovirus: it infects one of the types of cells that make up your immune system. In that case there’s no point in trying to mimic the virus because it has already taken over the system that could have fought it. A completely different approach is required.,Neutral
gga0b4b,That’a a reasonable question and I share your concern about safety but after seeing how quickly Covid killed my otherwise strong father it’s a risk I’m willing to take. If more people saw what I did over the last few weeks I think they’d lean toward getting the vaccine too. I do see your concerns but from my new perspective the risk-benefit calculation weighs heavily in favor of the vaccine.,Positive
gr316xf,I think of it as “emergency skepticism authorization.”,Neutral
gquianu,Yes that’s correct but those molecules are produced in our body naturally so the immune system won’t recognize them as pathogens. The immune system will only get rid of the spike proteins produced by the vaccine because they’re foreign. Hope that makes sense,Neutral

glvjj3z,Yes! Barring bad weather I would jump at the chance. Bring some good music or audiobooks and have a nice long ride. Since I got my first shot (I am still being super careful - my hubby is immunocompromised) I feel a sense of relief &amp; hope. Good luck and safe travels! &lt;3,Positive

mhray6,Personal experience J&amp;J Confirmed covid case back in October 2020.I got the J&amp;J shot on Wednesday around 4pm felt nothing except a little arm pain. Drove home fine started cleaning everything was fine. Temp was around 97.3Temp is now 98. Around 12am that night I started noticing I was feeling cold and had muscle aches. I wanted nothing more than to bundle up with multiple layers of blankets. I head to bed and put about 4 layers of blankets on top. Cant stop the chills and between 12am and 5am I experience chills hot flashes and dehydration. Now it is preventing me from sleeping. Body still aches feel a little dizzy and went to get water. Take one Tylenol pill.,Positive

gqy06w5,Hi.I am someone who is not at all scared of Covid and would not take any of the vaccines for ANY amount of money offered. If hearing stories deter you then I would advise that you look up the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System) data because between these vaccines there are hundreds of thousands of injuries and thousands of deaths popping up and the worse thing is that only a small percent of actual events are recorded. These are not only unlike normal vaccines in that it involves dangerous cell hacking technology but they are also practically untested in humans. Here are some articles from mainstream sciencemedical sites which they don't tell you about:[[[Here's an important site with links to VAERS and many other death reports:[If you are in fear of Covid you could talk to your doctor about taking Ivermectin or Quercetin:[[Zinc Vitamin C and Vitamin D would help immensely.The worst from these vaccines could be to come and for many it will according to educated empathetic people who are not scaring people into getting vaccines to keep their job.,Neutral

m3akpl,Is anyone else offended by the COVID vaccine distribution plans? Is anyone else offended by the COVID vaccine distribution plans? I can't help but find myself really offended for so many reasons. Here's a quick list:   1. Politicians are playing god with at best weak information. I don't trust politicians in the best of times. I certainly don't trust them now. This isn't about party affiliation either. On one side we've seen mask burning and the active spread of COVID and on the other we've seen states placing still contagious patients into nursing homes. None of them have earned trust over the past year. Now they've been given more responsibility? This should not be possible.2. The government monopolized the entire production primarily so they could play god and dictate politically with weak information the order in which the vaccine would be given to whom. 3. I find the government's distribution offensive.    1. First they started with the politicians and this included Republicans including outgoing politicians that had made a point of lying about COVID then rejecting its existence then actively spreading it. Rewarding people that adopted antisocial behavior with priority access should in my book be considered amoral.     2. Second it was made available to huge groups of individuals based upon political power largely without regard to medical susceptibility need or value while being forbidden to people that really need it. This was simultaneously incredibly wasteful and deadly.  While some groups like seniors are more likely to suffer negative effects they're **not** most at risk not even close. Groups with far more need were and still are excluded from treatment.  How important are genetics? Nearly a third of all nurses that died of COVID were Filipino despite making up only 4% of the population of nurses. That does not even account for comorbidities.  People within broadly targeted age or political groups should never have been offered a vaccine based simply upon their age or political status.  People with certain genetic makeups and comorbidities are far more at risk and should have been prioritized as should people with respiratory diseases cancer RA lupus psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases diabetes should have been vaccinated especially early.   Moreover they didn't deprioritize people that had earned immunity through infection. These people were already 90% less likely to re-contract COVID. They'd also already shown that they're highly likely to survive. That they survived the first time is a good indicator genetics are on their size. Given at most a 5% marginal benefit those doses should without a doubt have gone to people without a history especially high-risk individuals without histories. [   Spending doses where they should never have been spent leaves people that really needed them to die.     3. Third the organizations that have the information to make better decisions about how to allocate and which should have been competing to get their members vaccinated namely HMOs insurance organizations and health care providers have been cut out of the decision-making entirely. I have no doubt that Kaiser Permanente my HMO could and would have made far better decisions about how to maximize the effectiveness of doses just like they do any other drug. In my case due to damage that occurred from hemochromatosis (iron levels that are too high due to genetics) I wound up with kidney liver and pancreatic damage (i.e. diabetes) and separately Lp(a) which means that I'm a hypercoagulator. Moreover I also have two of the eight genetic super variations that lead to death in the event of infection (one deals with the hypercoagulation the other de-surfacing my lungs in the even I'm infected). Knowing this I have no doubt my physician or hematologist would have prioritized my need. Instead I'm queuing behind people with far less need because I'm 49 despite the fact I'm exactly the type that will die or at least become severely sick if infected including apparently in the event I survive losing limbs. I've done everything I can. I effectively have not left home since March except to walk in my neighborhood. I've learned everything I can. While others have gained weight I've reduced my weight by twenty-five percent.      4. There have been huge differences in doses allocated between states as well as within states. In Alaska there are enough doses for any adult that wants one to get one and other states like Connecticut have also received over allocations despite the fact they've had low rates in any case. Here in my state there have also been huge allocation differences. The initial allocation to my county the fifth largest in the state was a third less *per capita* than the fourth largest county despite the fact we have an active outbreak here right now (they just reopened the high school to shut it down again three days later due to the outbreak). [  Now what they're saying is that there won't be enough vaccines for everyone to get one but whoever wants one will be able to get one regardless of need by the first of May. This means all those people that have real medical conditions won't be able to get the shots they need because all the early doses have been wasted on those that simply did not need them or at least did not need them nearly as badly as those with underlying conditions without histories. By the time a vaccine would be made available for me the truth is that it'll be irrelevant. I'll have spent more than a year in lockdown left to die for political expedience and frankly it makes me angry. I feel no hope only anger because of the message my government keeps repeating that I don't matter but the people at The Villages do despite the fact that they've been running parades and playing bridge daily do. This is just not ok with me.,Neutral

llp9uc,Hives 12 hours after Moderna vaccine? Hi EveryoneI received my second Moderna vaccine on 21321 and 12 hours after I started to have chills fever body aches and the weirdest thing of all was I started feeling very itchy as well. I went to bed and when I woke up in the morning I noticed clusters of red dots on my arms neck thigh stomach and back. The next day the dots were gone from their original location but I had new red dots elsewhere. The dots aren't very itchy but they're still here 3 days later and still migrating to different parts of my body. I'm curious as to whether or not I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine? If it is an allergic reaction why didn't I have it to the first dose and then why is it happening 12 hrs after the second dose? Any thoughts?,Neutral

kzkgw9,Pfizer 6 days post 2nd shot. [ This is my personal experience] I received the shot around 10am on the 12th.  - 9 hours in I had joint pain took Tylenol and went to sleep. - 12 hours in I was woken up by body fatigue joint pain and chills. It was harsh as hell. I could barley walk. I called into work. - 15 hours in still had chills and joint pain but it wasn’t as bad. Slight headache. Somehow fell back asleep. - 18 hours in I took Tylenol and felt like I could function enough to move around the house(big mistake). By the end of the night I was fatigued. January 14th I felt fine. I was able to go to my doctors appointment with no issue and luckily it was my day off. Tried to stay hydrated and off my feet. January 15th: woke up fine and went to work. About two hours in I had to leave. Granted I work a physical job and definitely pushed myself. I went home and laid on the sofa. January 16th: I made it 4 hours into work and started to feel fatigued again. The fatigued wasn’t as bad as the day before so I was able to work my whole shift. Today: I made it through my whole shift with no issues. I think the last two days was my body being warn down from the shot and not so much the side effects. All in all I think it was worth it. I’ll take half a week of feeling those side effects over actually catching covid. Stay safe.,Neutral
ggfba4e,So I asked my the Occ health manager at my hospital he said it was NOT manufactured with egg products. The waiver list of potential allergens did not include egg products. So I decided to take it. I so far have not had any side effects after 24 hours or receiving the vaccine.,Neutral

gisin1b,Hey all. Arms killing me today 810 scale and I'm still itchy here and there but it's definitely decreased. Last night was rough for all over muscle and joint pain  especially my knees If I had them bent for any length of time. I did have a slight bout of nausea for a minute or two and then it went away.  No other symptoms as of now today. I'm still debating on whether or not I want to get the second dose. I think I might just be ready to go to the hospital for a possible anaphylactic reaction especially if it increases in severity as most people with their second shot do. I think I might try following a super antihistamine diet two weeks before to see if that can help lessen the reaction. If I am reacting to PEG waiting for another vaccine like the one dose Johnson &amp; Johnson won't really do any good because they have polysorbate in theirs and those two chemicals are very closely related so if I have a reaction to one I'll probably have a reaction to the other.,Neutral

gmx38lj,Ugh.The whole point of the vaccine is to get your body to produce antibodies to fight the infection. If you get exposed your body will fight it immediately. In the unlikely case that you are contagious it will be for a very short time and you will be shedding a lot less virus then if you did not have the vaccine. It is very doubtful that you will spread the disease to others. Your risk to others is nowhere near as high as if you were not vaccinated.In the way your immune system will react it is not really any different than other vaccinations. You were vaccinated against measles and while you may carry it for a short time if exposed it is VERY unlikely you would ever infect someone else.,Negative
ggxgt73,I also had the moderna vaccine at 10:30 yesterday. I came home and took a nap afterwards and then ran last minute errands and went about my business just like any other day. I didn't get the injection site soreness until last night this morning but it has been very minimal. I just took a shower and it's pretty much just a dull ache now. Nothing that I would even take Tylenol for.

gl7mypz,As rough and unfortunate as it is unfortunately people do die all the time from all sorts of things just because they got the vaccine a week prior or even a day prior doesn’t mean anything unless there’s a mechanism for it causing that. So far we haven’t found anything. I can completely understand it being scary to see a headline saying “person dies 2 days after covid vaccine” but it’s really just to get clicks and to stir people up. mRNA is broken down incredibly quickly by enzymes in our cells if there were any long term effects it would be caused by an interaction of mRNA and DNA or proteins that we don’t know of yet and gene regulation and DNA is incredibly heavily studied. This all is also my education background so perhaps that’s why I’m quick to dismiss the concerns but it’s not helpful if I do that so I apologize :,Negative

lbc6iz,"Effects of Cholesterol Medications on the Pfizer Vaccine In my own interest I researched what was in the Pfizer vaccine as far as ingredients and came upon this list:	As for the other ingredients of the Pfizer COVID vaccine they're pretty straightforward. It's made up of the mRNA wrapped in what Dr. Malvestutto says you can think of as a ""fat bubble"" — lipid nanoparticles that protect the mRNA so it can do its job. The FDA lists these additional ingredients as: lipids ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-61-diyl)bis(2- hexyldecanoate) 2-[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-NN-ditetradecylacetamide 12-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine and cholesterol) potassium chloride monobasic potassium phosphate sodium chloride dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate and sucrose.  My family and I suffer from familial hypercholesterolemia and are on most of the medications available to fight cholesterol in most ways.	- Welchol	- Zetia	- Crestor	- RepathaWe don’t take just one of these we take ALL of them at the same time. My understanding is that the goal of the cholesterol medication is to block the absorption of lipids into the liver (thereby not allowing cholesterol to pass into the blood). My concern is: Wouldn’t those medications prevent the Covid vaccine from entering into the blood stream?  Especially if the mRNA is wrapped in a lipid nanoparticle?Is there research on that?",Positive

gqjasbh,You’re welcome! So in a normal vaccine they usually last for years (think tetanus shot you get every 10 years aka a booster shot) and you have antibodies that last for a long time. Good example I got the smallpox vaccine in the military and that one induces such a strong response that I’ll have the antibodies well into my 80-90s. But with Covid it may be different simply because it can mutate much faster than smallpox due to many reasons one of them being that covid is found in intermediate reservoirs (animals) and is zoonotic whereas smallpox doesn’t have a reservoir (no one knows where it even came from) so it’s not found in nature where it can mutate like covid can. Now if it is only good for say 7 months if you get it after that time period you most likely won’t have THAT severe of an infection as you would if you didn’t get the vaccine. Youd get sick sure but you won’t be down for the count like those who got the virus in the past year. That’s the unfortunate thing because this is happening in real time and we can’t for sure say how long it protects we are assuming it’ll protect at least 6 months to a year after getting the vaccine. We won’t know for sure until more time passes but it is definitely worth getting. Who knows it may be way better than we initially thought!The goal is produce long term antibodies plasma cells and memory T cells so that if you were to come into contact with it two years from now your immune system will instantly know what it is and attack it before it can infect cells and wreak havoc. Because these vaccines are so new we won’t know until years later. I wouldn’t say you’re in the same boat as unvaccinated people who didn’t get sick you’d have some protection that would act faster and get over it quicker than unvaccinated individuals!,Positive
gr7h2rm,Don’t be swayed by misinformation. I received the vaccine on Friday and I’m doing just fine.,Positive
gt1yhob,No evidence but there are also no studies past 6 months. No evidence does not equal no effects. It could be equal or worse. Probably not but you don't know.,Negative
giuk67l,Same here brother felt fine until I got to roughly hour 12 and then started to have all the symptoms. Worst is headache and chills. Feels like I got run over by a semi. But good to know I’m not alone and the duration doesn’t appear to be too long.,Neutral
mhyz3w,Last week I got my wisdom teeth out and now I have hives all over. It’s probably from a combo of sun exposure and my antibiotic. My first dose of vaccine is scheduled for this afternoon.

gqvo41w,I'm about 36 hours out from my shot and I feel completely normal in every way. I read that 10% of people in the trial didn't have detectable antibodies after four weeks – makes me wonder if my lack of side effects means that my immune system didn't notice.,Positive

gsz1bz5,Its not new theyve been experimenting for years. They had the vaccine ready and needed the reason to deploy the vaccine it omly took last year to mass produce it.,Neutral
gr1hxa3,Of course. I called every Walgreens in my area. One set an appointment for me in the morning. They had set appointments aside for those that could not book online and that slot wasn't filled. Another put me on a wait list and said they would probably call in the late afternoon if someone didn't show up. I went in at 10:30am for my appointment and got the vaccine. The other Walgreens called at 4:50pm and I said that while I already got the vaccine someone in my home who was not eligible also wanted the vaccine. I told them that I understood if there were other people on the list and they were free to call them instead but I could be there in fifteen minutes if they were willing to give the vaccine to him. Because they were ready to close shop on the vaccine clinic for the day were uncertain if they could get a hold of someone in time and did not want to throw out the dose they told me to bring him there ASAP.,Neutral

gjdm742,I’ve felt like this too. I really do believe it’s my thoughts around getting the vaccine that have made me feel this way. Knowing that we are some of the first people to ever receive this vaccine is very weird and anxious but awesome at the same time. Our minds can play some weird tricks on us,Neutral
gst9v6v,Update- I rested on Monday - my arm hurt and last night I did have a low grade fever 100. Woke up this morning feeling fine.  I did use an ice pack on my arm yesterday. My arm feels the same as when I have received flu shots. I was having some anxiety as I live alone and since the vaccines are so new it always makes a person nervous getting them.  Glad it is done.,Positive
glizjsc,On the CDC website you can look up information about the lot number your vaccine came from to see the commonly reported symptoms. Granted it’s not verified that all of the symptoms are from the vaccine itself which the site does a good job making clear it’s just “here’s anythingeverything a person had anytime after receiving the vaccine” as reported throughby a doctor. But I still personally found it pretty interesting and validating.,Positive
gk3wnhu,Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I will be receiving my 2nd dose of the Moderna Vaccine on Monday.  After the 1st dose I only experienced mild pain at the injection site and on Day 7 I had body chills.,Positive
lrxjya,Brain fog for 3 days after getting Pfizer vaccine I got my vaccine last Sunday and have experienced brain fog and disorientation since.   Has anyone else had that symptom?,Positive
gk6m2zm,I have psoriasis and I don’t take medication! It’s been four days since I got the Pfizer shot. I feel good today except for a splitting headache (which I’m pretty sure is from drinking and staying up too late last night). Yesterday and the day before I had some pretty bad stomach symptoms. Nausea cramps. I also was exhausted and slept way more than usual. My arm was incredibly sore for about a day. They all seem like pretty normal symptoms but just on the severe side. I’m sure you’ll be fine too!,Positive
gqz7flx,What you’re feeling is pretty much expected with a side of anxiety. I’m in the same boat 31f who had COVID before first Pfizer yesterday. After about 24h I got a fever (99.9) slight chillsheadache and a cold sore. Still WAY better than when I had COVID.,Neutral
gomzaot,The headache hit me very soon afte indeed like 2h. But this isn't a show stopper at all. Really manageable.However the fever and shivers started around 8-10h after the shots (this was at night for me so not while working). This one rather took me down but an ibuprofen was able to come it down each time I had a peak.So depending whether you receive the jab in the morning or the afternoon be aware you might potentially get fever. But you might get nothing too.Ibuprofen  paracetamol help with the fever.Drink plenty of water. Eat some carbs for long term storing energy.Good shot!,Neutral

I got my vaccine this morning and had really awful side effects but I just woke up from a nap and feel better. Even while puking my guts out I didn't regret getting it.

But they are eligible based on the rules in the State of Virginia.Could they try to get an appointment in a town in Virginia (50 miles north) and qualify as someone with serious preexisting medical conditions?

m4wb3r,Vaccine Ethos   In the past few weeks in daily encounters with people trying to make conversation people have asked me in a casual way like asking about the weather “Did you get your COVID vaccine?” Actually I am still waiting. I am far down the priority list. I’m *Only* 62. I’m not fat nor do I have any other chronic lifestyle disease. I don’t work in a special job. When I reply with “I’m not eligible” people often offer suggestions about how I could beat the system. Beating the system often involves lying or cheating in some way. I can’t do that. Which brings me to the topic of ethos. My thesis: the methods by which people obtain a vaccine show their ethos. White privileged Americans are showing their ethos. The predominant ethos is deservability and unqualified right. What is ethos? Your ethos is your character. In rhetorical argument good character is important. You can believe and trust someone with good character. Ethos is how you show up in the world. What is your ethos? There are some basic privileges which the currently vaccinated have although they may not recognize them. They are things like internet access transportation and time. These privileges do make up one’s ethos even if one doesn’t think about them. If one didn’t have these privileges one wouldn’t yet have received a vaccine. Another way to get vaccine privilege is to work adjacent to a privileged category like to have an accounting job in a hospital. This person is not exposed in their job but the hospital will finagle an extra dose for these employees. Some people have bribed their way into the vaccine line. Money buys many privileges vaccines are just one of them. Some people are just lucky. They were standing in the pharmacy at the end of the day and happened to snag an extra dose. Maybe in today’s moral environment there is nothing immoral about any of this. But somehow other than old people I know many younger people who got a vaccine through some back door method like this.Another way to get a vaccine is to have a lifestyle disease like obesity or diabetes. Yes I say it now. These people are at higher morbidity risk from COVID. But their problems are of their own making. Why should they get special privileges? From a public health point of view yes special categories of people should get vaccines as soon as possible. But it is a situation tinged with special privileges maybe earned through years of physical neglect. Victimhood is another description of “specialness.”Where you live is a vaccine privilege. It is not just the country but where in the country. Notice that in the US within any state or county vaccine privileges vary. I live in a Democratic city in a state with a Trumpist Republican governor. Despite the state being short of doses in general the Republican governor sent more vaccines to the Republican countryside first. Presumably that is where his voting base resides. If you don’t have vaccine privilege what do you have? Vaccine poverty. Many people who were poor to begin with don’t have the rest of the means to obtain a vaccine. Many people don’t have specialness or luck or some other back door. So they are vaccine poor. The liars are the ones that really bother me. I have been offered several methods for lying in order to get a vaccine. People I thought were pretty good people are telling me to lie to cut in line. I can’t do this. My ethos is not that. The other people who bother me are those who flaunt their vaccine cheating without at all realizing that they are flaunting an ethos of cheating. My ethos has something to do with personal integrity. Only a humble or sincerely honest ethos can defend against claiming unqualified rights and privileges. I am politely waiting in the vaccine line until it is my lawful turn.,Positive

gfvhfqk,I’m not talking about a sore arm I’m talking about people died from the vaccine. If your gonna ignore me just don’t reply but don’t make stuff up to try and make me look like I’m an idiot. Like I said take it if you want but you have no right to force someone else to play Russian Roulette with an untested vaccine. I’m not whining about my rights or freedom but even if I was it’s not a bad thing. To be honest I don’t really care what you want me to do if you don’t care about the freedom of others. Its stupid to force people against their will to possibly commit suicide so that they might get a disease with a high survival rate. Until further testing is done we have no idea if the vaccine is more dangerous than the actual virus,Neutral
gi5g49a,Thank you for asking these questions. I have exactly the same worries about the vaccine. I am a neurologically weak person (anxiety disorder depression migraines dizziness exhaustion) and I don't want to provoke anything of these symptoms again I just made it until now being free of these symptoms.I am absolutely pro vaccine. But I fear this one.,Neutral
gjxi5c8,I cant believe you had the choice at all.,Neutral
gkzs4lc,Another thing to think about is potentially the government making policies with their vaccine distribution to limit a person's ability to line jump. Here in California we haven't even touched on underlying medical conditions. My theory is it's because it'd be too hard to verify. It would welcome anyone that wants to line jump to go ahead and do it. It really sucks if potentially we're excluding an at risk population from getting vaccinated just to make sure people don't continue to line jump.Anyway thanks for refusing it. I refused one too despite tons of pressure from my family. Now I'm extra stressed that I'm going to get COVID and disappoint them lol.,Positive

gqglp4s,You know what has much worse long term affects? COVID. Millions of people have even died from it. There really are few long term affects worse than death. The one thing I can think of as worse is the guilt of causing the death of another due to rejecting getting the vaccine. This vaccine has been already given to the weakest among us (like people in managed care) with virtually no consequence. Unless you are already on your death bed you should get it. People who regret getting it because they felt bad for 24 hours are just selfish asshats. You should feel like a monster for not getting. You are putting others at risk.

The reaction (when it is a normal one - any thing out of ordinary check that out) tends to be a good sign that your body is fighting it.    I'm in a trial for Novavax and I kinda think my first shot was worse.  But the injection area was more inflammed (I don't think i would call it swollen).  And warm to the touch.    I was totally waiting for 2nd to be worse and it wasn't.,Positive

kvfjwu,Reaction after first vaccine (Moderna) Hives all over my face Hives as only covid symptom?I’m a bit confused. I went to my doctor today because the last two nights I’ve had inexplicable explosions of hives on my face. The doctor told me I was likely getting viral hives as a reaction to the moderna covid vaccine I received on 13. That makes sense covid takes 5-7 days to strike and the rash showed up 6 days after the shot. The doctor told me that they have seen covid folks presenting with viral hives before and as an afterthought told me to get a covid test too as a precaution. I went to lunch with a friend on Friday and wore my mask the whole time except for when we ate. The hives appeared the next day. I don’t have any other symptom - no fever cough loss of tastesmell.I got my test today but I’m at a total loss at what to do. My parents want to kick me out of the house and return to school ASAP because my dad has heart failure which is fair. They blame my lunch - but I don’t think that covid would appear so suddenly about 32 hours after we ate. My impression was that it was minimum 2 days to appear. I am wearing a mask at home now. I think this isn’t covid but a reaction to the vaccine. Did anyone else experience it? It’s pretty concerning as I don’t have allergies to anything else I know of.,Neutral

gqjnej7,Hi Nate I did not take a picture of her before the vaccine because I didn’t know this would happen. Are you referring to just a normal picture of her arm before the vaccine. Also I updated to another comment. Within 4 hours my moms arm returned to her regular color. It was scary. The doctors and nurses said to keep and eye. We set a doctors appointment for next week and will be letting them know what happened. I will make an update once we get information but I am HOPING and guessing It was just a reaction or allergic reaction or anything of the sort,Neutral
gsz4ymf,So sorry to hear this . Not trying to scare you  but Same thing happened to my MIL and FIL . MIL  was same age  but she didn’t get COVIDVaccine. She had HBP that was under control. They told us old age. Started in August 2020 she was gone by November 2020.My FIL was 94. Never got Covid vaccine .He started January 2021 he just died two days ago. Dr said old age also.

gegk4mc,actuallyeven with location off location can be tracked from simply knowing what wifi network you're connected to or through your ISP. so if the government wanted to track you you might not want to have a phone with you.second an injection that would have a nanodevice that used GPS signals would be *extremely* costly if ever so were possible. such a device that would have to have some sort of constant power supply that would have to last however many years which would have to be concealed within a fraction of a millimeter to possibly fit through a shot needle. implanted devices are as a result most of the time powered by a little filament that it's connected to that leads to a power supply outside of the body. i can promise you this since i work around a field of electronics there is no chip anywhere near sight of the future to be able to be injected in your body and by any means be able to track your location.edit: lastly i just want to say i'm not here to ridicule you or make fun of you because a few others have been doing so instead of bringing up evidence which would maybe be more useful than just a bunch of hurled insults.,Positive

gmv2ilj,...and just a tiny amount of them got the second dose yet.Thank you for beta testing the vaccine. The human guinea pigs already found out that it can cause rare blood diseases that it makes you be detected breast cancer and pregnant women reported miscarriages.Those are all things that were not looked at in any study. There is not a single study about effects past 2 months. Not a single study on pregnancies or fertility. They don't even know if the vaccine still offers protection after two months.So lets wait and let the guinea pigs test it for us. I would be crazy to take an untested experimental vaccine if so many people voluntarily inject it into their body to test it for me... simply because some guy on TV told them that it is save without telling them that 45% of them will require painkillers.,Neutral

lauvth,"Covid 19 Vaccines: Honest doubts This is all too weird hear me out.And before I start just because someone is asking questions about something does not mean that the person is creating a conspiracy theory.Strange official and legit facts:- Why do most governments want people with low risk to the virus to get vaccine? Only people that are 50 years old and older or people with pre-conditions are at risk the rest (vast majority) have 99.98% of survival.- For the non-risk people isn't it riskier to inject a vaccine made with brand new techonology (experiment) with no correct safety testing performed and with unknown long-term effects than to just have the virus and get done with it? Specially when neither the government and neither the vaccine manufacturers are not responsible for any adverse effects.- You may claim that some non-risk people had long-Covid but is it really better to put a vaccine which you don't know long term effects?- Official CDC reports (last time checked: 01022021) about COVID-19 vaccine adverse effects had 2.37% of deaths. Yes this is on the official reports.- Imagine if there are people that don't want to take vaccine it would be ok... Because the ones that want the vaccine are protected from the virus from the vaccine and the people that don't want to take the vaccine would have their suffer their own consequences...And only affect the non-vaccine takers. Now I ask why does every government want to vaccinate the WHOLE population? Does not make any sense.- Why the media are not talking about treatments or medication about COVID-19? All of the options that showed up are being banned or not even mentioned. Isn't that weird?- The flu vaccine was not required only recommended for non-risk people. Why are most of the media and governments talking about COVID-19 being mandatory for everyone even for people with 99.98% survival rate?- Media and governments talking about COVID-19 being mandatory for everyone if this is true it goes against the Nuremberg Code Article 6 Sections 1 and 3. Yes the Nuremberg Code has not been officially accepted as law by any nation or as official ethics guidelines by any association but doesn't this show the imoral and draconian measures the government are having IF the vaccine will be mandatory for EVERYONE?- Some people claim that there will be healthvaccine passport for everyday use (go to bank go to gymn go to supermarket etc). Why is it required for a virus that most people survive 99.98% of the time and was never required for vaccines for more deadly viruses? If the rules are the same as the other vaccines it makes sense... More than that it's weird and people should be skeptical...- All the media of all countries seems to be pushing the vaccines TOO hard. *Puts tinfoil hat* it seems they are trying too hard to brain wash. But really if you saw documentaries about NAZI CIA Communism etc brainwashing techniques... It is identical.&amp; x200B;I have much more questions but if the text is too long no one will read it. The measures are too tyranical and should be asked with skepticism. The vaccines should only be mandatory after they proven that it is safe from dangerous adverse effects which is only after some years...  For CDC reports of vaccine adverse reaction:  go to "" "" press that you agree the Disclaimer go to tab ""Request Form"" go to section 3. and select COVID 19 press send.",Neutral

gqga4y7,Chances that they gave you the other vaccine is pretty much zero. Very few if any sites have both vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine requires lower temps so it is pretty much reserved for sites that have the facilities to store it. (often just large coolers with dry ice but still),Neutral

gwpwlry,This has always been a question people ask with vaccines - because there are people who cannot get vaccines for medical reasons and the herd immunity protects those people and because if everyone vaccinates against something it can almost eliminate it from the population,Neutral
gwykh8d,Immunosuppressants can make the vaccine less or ineffective. Also cancer treatments can mess up your immune system and make you more at risk of infections and less likely to respond to vaccines. Babies and elderly people also tend to have weaker immune responses and need protection provided by the people around them.,Neutral
gk7i8oq,You certainly are saying one life is more important than another.  Teachers are interacting with hundreds of students putting them at significant risk.  They have just a much right as anyone else to get the vaccine early. Frankly our elderly population who is most at risk of dying should be getting all the initial doses.  I can’t believe how selfish you are putting yourself in front of them when they have a much much higher likelihood of actually dying.,Positive

A Relative of mine had this happen with the first shot of moderna.,Neutral
gj833l9,I got my second 24 hours ago. I have had no problems other than a sore arm. I feel like I'm waiting for the second shoe to drop. Does anyone know the outside window of when symptoms would appear? I have to fly today and I am afraid a fever is going to flare up right before I try to board (30 hrs out from shot). I have been alternating Advil and Tylenol since before the shot. Hoping for the best.,Positive
gqkyy8d,I think it’s safe just because the vector is similar to what we encounter throughout our lives whenever we get a cold. It’s not as effective as the mRNA vaccines but everything I’ve read it seems like it depends on where you are at geographically as far as effectiveness goes. But it does protect against severe disease and I think that’s the most important factor. But I honestly think it’s safe!I definitely get the attraction to it one shot and you’re done instead of the two shots. I know many are afraid of needles so I can empathize. I’ve never been afraid of needles so the two shot didn’t bother me. And a lot are apprehensive about the mRNA technology and I get that too the general public won’t know all of the science behind it and I don’t expect them to. I really get why people are questioning it and that’s a good thing. I’d prefer questioning over blind acceptance!,Neutral

ghwlh3b,I received it 4 days ago from Moderna. I was fine the first day but the next day my arm was incredibly painful to the touch and I couldn’t extend it overhead or move it much at all which lasted two days. I also developed chills body aches and spiked a 103 fever. The fever resolved the day after but chills and body aches remained for one more day. The following two days I’ve had an intense HA and have been fatigued to the point I’ve needed to nap throughout the day. I hope the headache resolves tomorrow because it’s quite intense. I was not expecting this sort of reaction and I feel that that the potential side effects and longevity of them were not fully communicated by the maker. Anyone who gets the vaccine should be aware of what they could potentially be dealing with. I’m a bit hesitant to get the second dose now personally.,Neutral

gok1wj0,Go through the NYC H&amp;H website and do the questionnaire.  Click check appointments and when it says no appointments available uncheck the box next to your name and recheck it.  It’ll refresh the appointment check.  Keep doing that till you get one.  12-1am is a good time but they can pop up anytime. Also follow   on Twitter and set notifications to whenever he posts.  Then go to turbovax.info and use a browser plug-in to auto fresh every 5 seconds and keep it up while you’re doing other stuff on the computer. Got both my parents vaccine appointments this way.Btw as of now pharmacies are only vaccinating 65+,Positive
gsya6nk,I am emetophobic also however did not experience any nausea with the first vaccine. I just keep telling myself that feeling achy and nauseous for one day far outweighs feeling that way for 14 or ending up hospitalized. Several of my friends got Moderna. No one was nauseous or threw up. Just a headache and fatigue. I am also really anxious about this but again....not getting covid is a very good trade-off (especially because everyone I know that got covid DID throw up).
